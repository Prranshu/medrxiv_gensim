       "'The quest for the ecological niches of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ranged from wineries to oaks and more recently to the gut of Crabro Wasps. Here we propose the role of the human gut in shaping S. cerevisiae evolution, presenting the genetic structure of a previously unknown population of yeasts, associated with Crohns disease, providing evidence for clonal expansion within humans gut. To understand the role of immune function in the human-yeast interaction we classified strains according to their immunomodulatory properties, discovering a set of genetically homogeneous isolates, capable of inducing anti-inflammatory signals via regulatory T cells proliferation, and on the contrary, a positive association between strain mosaicism and ability to elicit inflammatory, IL-17 driven, immune responses. The approach integrating genomics with immune phenotyping showed selection on genes involved in sporulation and cell wall remodeling as central for the evolution of S. cerevisiae Crohns strains from passengers to commensals to potential pathogens.'"

      "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the major internalisation route for many different receptor types in mammalian cells. CME is shut down during early mitosis, but the mechanism of this inhibition is unclear. Here we show that the mitotic shutdown is due to an unmet requirement for actin in CME. In mitotic cells, membrane tension is increased and this invokes a requirement for the actin cytoskeleton to assist the CME machinery to overcome the increased load. However, the actin cytoskeleton is engaged in the formation of a rigid cortex in mitotic cells and is therefore unavailable for deployment. We demonstrate that CME can be \\\"restarted\\\" in mitotic cells despite high membrane tension, by allowing actin to engage in endocytosis. Mitotic phosphorylation of endocytic proteins is maintained in mitotic cells with restored CME, indicating that direct phosphorylation of the CME machinery does not account for shutdown.\n",

      "The canonical protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B has traditionally been considered to exclusively reside on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Using confocal microscopy, we show that endogenous PTP1B actually exhibits a higher local concentration at the mitochondria in all mammalian cell lines that we tested. Fluorescently labeled chimeras containing full-length PTP1B or only its 35 amino acid tail anchor localized identically, demonstrating the complete dependence of PTP1Bs subcellular partitioning on its tail anchor. Correlative light and electron microscopy using GFP-driven photo-oxidation of DAB revealed that PTP1Bs tail anchor localizes it to the mitochondrial interior and to mitochondrial-associated membrane (MAM) sites along the ER. Heterologous expression of the tail anchor of PTP1B in the yeast S. cerevisiae surprisingly led to its exclusive localization to the ER/vacuole with no presence at the mitochondria. Studies with various yeast mutants of conserved membrane insertion pathways revealed a role for the GET/TRC40 pathway in ER insertion, but also emphasized the likely dominant role of spontaneous insertion. Further studies of modified tail isoforms in both yeast and mammalian cells revealed a remarkable sensitivity of subcellular partitioning to slight changes in transmembrane domain (TMD) length, C-terminal charge, and hydropathy. For example, addition of a single positive charge to the tail anchor was sufficient to completely shift the tail anchor to the mitochondria in mammalian cells and to largely shift it there in yeast cells, and a point mutation that increased TMD hydropathy was sufficient to localize the tail anchor exclusively to the ER in mammalian cells. Striking differences in the subcellular partitioning of a given tail anchor isoform in mammalian versus yeast cells most likely point to fundamental differences in the lipid composition of specific organelles (e.g. affecting membrane charge or thickness) in higher versus lower eukaryotes. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) detection of the Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)-based interaction of the catalytic domain of PTP1B with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1) at the mitochondria revealed a strong interaction on the cytosolic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), suggesting the presence of a significant pool of PTP1B there and a novel role for PTP1B in the regulation of mitochondrial ErbB1 activity. In summary, in addition to its well-established general localization along the ER, our results reveal that PTP1B specifically accumulates at MAM sites along the ER and localizes as well to the OMM and mitochondrial matrix. Further elucidation of PTP1Bs roles in these different locations (including the identification of its targets) will likely be critical for understanding its complex regulation of general cellular responses, cell proliferation, and diseased states.\n",
      "Proteasome inhibition elicits an evolutionarily conserved response wherein proteasome subunit mRNAs are upregulated, resulting in recovery of proteasome activity. We previously demonstrated that the transcription factor Nrf1 mediates this homeostatic response in mammalian cells. We show here that Nrf1 is initially translocated into the lumen of the ER, but is rapidly and efficiently retrotranslocated to the cytosolic side of the membrane in a manner that depends on p97/VCP. Normally, retrotranslocated Nrf1 is degraded by the proteasome and active species do not accumulate. However, in cells with compromised proteasomes, retrotranslocated Nrf1 escapes degradation and is cleaved N-terminal to Leu-104 to yield a fragment that is no longer tethered to the ER-membrane. Importantly, this cleavage event is essential for Nrf1-dependent activation of proteasome gene expression upon proteasome inhibition. Our data uncover an unexpected role for p97 in activation of a transcription factor by relocalizing it from the ER lumen to the cytosol.\n",

      "Herein we demonstrate how nanojunctions between lysosomes and sarcoplasmic reticulum (L-SR junctions) serve to couple lysosomal activation to regenerative, ryanodine receptor-mediated cellular Ca2+ waves. In pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) it has been proposed that nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) triggers increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ via L-SR junctions, in a manner that requires initial Ca2+ release from lysosomes and subsequent Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) via ryanodine receptor (RyR) subtype 3 on the SR membrane proximal to lysosomes. L-SR junction membrane separation has been estimated to be < 400 nm and thus beyond the resolution of light microscopy, which has restricted detailed investigations of the junctional coupling process. The present study utilizes standard and tomographic transmission electron microscopy to provide a thorough ultrastructural characterization of the L-SR junctions in PASMCs. We show that L-SR nanojunctions are prominent features within these cells and estimate that the junctional membrane separation and extension are about 15 nm and 300 nm, respectively. Furthermore, we develop a quantitative model of the L-SR junction using these measurements, prior kinetic and specific Ca2+ signal information as input data. Simulations of NAADP-dependent junctional Ca2+ transients demonstrate that the magnitude of these signals can breach the threshold for CICR via RyR3. By correlation analysis of live cell Ca2+ signals and simulated Ca2+ transients within L-SR junctions, we estimate that \\\"trigger zones\\\" with a 60-100 junctions are required to confer a signal of similar magnitude. This is compatible with the 130 lysosomes/cell estimated from our ultrastructural observations. Most importantly, our model shows that increasing the L-SR junctional width above 50 nm lowers the magnitude of junctional [Ca2+] such that there is a failure to breach the threshold for CICR via RyR3. L-SR junctions are therefore a pre-requisite for efficient Ca2+ signal coupling and may contribute to cellular function in health and disease.\n",
      "Small molecule inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis are highly desired for the dissection of membrane trafficking pathways in the lab and for potential use as anti-infectives in the clinic. One inhibition strategy is to prevent clathrin from contacting adaptor proteins so that clathrin-mediated endocytosis cannot occur. \\\"Pitstop\\\" compounds have been developed which block only one of the four functional interaction sites on the N-terminal domain of clathrin heavy chain. Despite this limitation, Pitstop 2 causes profound inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In this study, we probed for non-specific activity of Pitstop 2 by examining its action in cells expressing clathrin heavy chain harbouring mutations in the N-terminal domain interaction sites. We conclude that the inhibition observed with this compound is due to non-specificity, i.e. it causes inhibition away from its proposed mode of action. We recommend that these compounds be used with caution in cells and that they should not be used to conclude anything of the function of clathrins N-terminal domain.\n",

      "Ecological studies routinely show genotype-genotype interactions between insects and their parasites. The mechanisms behind these interactions are not clearly understood. Using the bumblebee Bombus terrestris / trypanosome Crithidia bombi model system, we have carried out a transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression and alternative splicing in bees during C. bombi infection. We have performed four analyses, 1) comparing gene expression in infected and non-infected bees 24 hours after infection by Crithidia bombi, 2) comparing expression at 24 and 48 hours after C.bombi infection, 3) searching for differential gene expression associated with the host-parasite genotype-genotype interaction at 24 hours after infection and 4) searching for alternative splicing associated with the host-parasite genotype-genotype interaction at 24 hours post infection. We found a large number of genes differentially regulated related to numerous canonical immune pathways. These genes include receptors, signaling pathways and effectors. We discovered a possible interaction between the peritrophic membrane and the insect immune system in defense against Crithidia. Most interestingly we found differential expression and alternative splicing of Dscam related transcripts and a novel immunoglobulin related gene Twitchin depends on the genotype-genotype interactions of the given bumblebee colony and Crithidia strain.\n",

      "Ecological studies routinely show genotype-genotype interactions between insects and their parasites. The mechanisms behind these interactions are not clearly understood. Using the bumblebee Bombus terrestris / trypanosome Crithidia bombi model system, we have carried out a transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression and alternative splicing in bees during C. bombi infection. We have performed four analyses, 1) comparing gene expression in infected and non-infected bees 24 hours after infection by Crithidia bombi, 2) comparing expression at 24 and 48 hours after C.bombi infection, 3) searching for differential gene expression associated with the host-parasite genotype-genotype interaction at 24 hours after infection and 4) searching for alternative splicing associated with the host-parasite genotype-genotype interaction at 24 hours post infection.

      "Plant innate immunity is mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and intracellular NB-LRR (nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat) proteins. Overexpression of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone, luminal-binding protein 3 (BiP3) compromises resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) mediated by the rice PRR XA21 (Park et al., PLoS ONE 5(2): e9262). Here we show that BiP3 overexpression also compromises resistance mediated by rice XA3, a PRR that provides broad-spectrum resistance to Xoo. In contrast, BiP3 overexpression has no effect on resistance mediated by rice Pi5, an NB-LRR protein that confers resistance to the fungal pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae (M. oryzae). Our results suggest that rice BiP3 regulates membrane-resident PRR-mediated immunity.\n",
      "Activation of the NADPH oxidase (NOX2) of the phagocytic vacuole of neutrophils is essential for innate immunity. Sustained activity of the oxidase requires that charge movements across the membrane are balanced. A role for the proton channel, HVCN1, has been proposed but not proven. Using the ratiometric pH indicator SNARF, introduced into the cytosol and separately into the vacuole coupled to Candida, we used confocal microscopy to measure changes in pH in these two compartments in human and mouse neutrophils. Shortly after phagocytosis by human cells, the vacuolar pH rose to ~9, at which it was maintained for ~20 minutes, while the cytosol showed a small acidification of ~0.25 pH unit. Alkalinisation has important consequences for the microbicidal and digestive functions of vacuolar enzymes. In HVCN1 knock out mouse neutrophils, the phagocytosis induced respiratory burst was halved to ~3 fmols per Candida, the vacuolar pH rose to >11 and the cytosol acidified excessively to pH ~6.75. These changes were prevented by the protonophore CCCP. The rate of extrusion of protons into the extracellular medium following phagocytosis was not significantly different from wild type neutrophils suggesting that cytoplasmic acidification resulted from the loss of the proton sink into the vacuole. HVCN1 phagocytic vacuoles showed considerable swelling, and this was blocked by CCCP and decreased by valinomycin. Stoichiometric considerations indicated that the HVCN1 channel compensates 90-95% of the oxidase-induced charge in normal cells, and in its absence, charge is carried by ions other than protons, including K+.\n",
      "Cycles of mitochondrial fission and fission are essential for normal cell physiology. Defects in the machinery controlling these processes lead to neurodegenerative disease. While we are beginning to understand the machinery that drives fission, our knowledge of the spatial and temporal control of this event is lacking. Here we use a rapamycin-inducible heterodimerization system comprising both ER and mitochondrial transmembrane components to bring the ER membrane into close physical proximity with mitochondria. We show that this artificial apposition of membranes is sufficient to cause rapid mitochondrial fragmentation. Resulting mitochondrial fragments are shown to be distinct entities using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. We also show that these fragments retain a mitochondrial membrane potential. In contrast, inducible tethering of the peripheral ER exit site protein TFG does not cause mitochondrial fragmentation suggesting that very close apposition of the two membranes is required.\n",
      "Sulfate-reducing bacteria play major roles in the global carbon and sulfur cycles, but it remains unclear how reducing sulfate yields energy. To determine the genetic basis of energy conservation, we measured the fitness of thousands of pooled mutants of Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 during growth in 12 different combinations of electron donors and acceptors. We show that ion pumping by the ferredoxin:NADH oxidoreductase Rnf is required whenever substrate-level phosphorylation is not possible. The uncharacterized complex Hdr/flox-1 (Dde_1207:13) is sometimes important alongside Rnf and may perform an electron bifurcation to generate more reduced ferredoxin from NADH to allow further ion pumping. Similarly, during the oxidation of malate or fumarate, the electron-bifurcating transhydrogenase NfnAB-2 (Dde_1250:1) is important and may generate reduced ferredoxin to allow additional ion pumping by Rnf. During formate oxidation, the periplasmic [NiFeSe] hydrogenase HysAB is required, which suggests that hydrogen forms in the periplasm, diffuses to the cytoplasm, and is used to reduce ferredoxin, thus providing a substrate for Rnf. During hydrogen utilization, the transmembrane electron transport complex Tmc is important and may move electrons from the periplasm into the cytoplasmic sulfite reduction pathway. Finally, mutants of many other putative electron carriers have no clear phenotype, which suggests that they are not important under our growth conditions.\n",
      "Plant plasma membrane localized pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detect extracellular pathogen-associated molecules. PRRs such as Arabidopsis EFR and rice XA21 are taxonomically restricted and are absent from most plant genomes. Here we show that rice plants expressing EFR or the chimeric receptor EFR::XA21, containing the EFR ectodomain and the XA21 intracellular domain, sense both Escherichia coli- and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo)-derived elf18 peptides at sub-nanomolar concentrations. Treatment of EFR and EFR::XA21 rice leaf tissue with elf18 leads to MAP kinase activation, reactive oxygen production and defense gene expression. Although expression of EFR does not lead to robust enhanced resistance to fully virulent Xoo isolates, it does lead to quantitatively enhanced resistance to weakly virulent Xoo isolates. EFR interacts with OsSERK2 and the XA21 binding protein 24 (XB24), two key components of the rice XA21-mediated immune response. Rice-EFR plants silenced for OsSERK2, or overexpressing rice XB24 are compromised in elf18-induced reactive oxygen production and defense gene expression indicating that these proteins are also important for EFR-mediated signaling in transgenic rice. Taken together, our results demonstrate the potential feasibility of enhancing disease resistance in rice and possibly other monocotyledonous crop species by expression of dicotyledonous PRRs. Our results also suggest that Arabidopsis EFR utilizes at least a subset of the known endogenous rice XA21 signaling components.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryPlants possess multi-layered immune recognition systems. Early in the infection process, plants use receptor proteins to recognize pathogen molecules. Some of these receptors are present in only in a subset of plant species. Transfer of these taxonomically restricted immune receptors between plant species by genetic engineering is a promising approach for boosting the plant immune system. Here we show the successful transfer of an immune receptor from a species in the mustard family, called EFR, to rice. Rice plants expressing EFR are able to sense the bacterial ligand of EFR and elicit an immune response. We show that the EFR receptor is able to use components of the rice immune signaling pathway for its function. Under laboratory conditions, this leads to an enhanced resistance response to two weakly virulent isolates of an economically important bacterial disease of rice.\n",

      "Transmembrane {beta}-barrels are known to play major roles in substrate transport and protein biogenesis in gram-negative bacteria, chloroplasts and mitochondria. However, the exact number of transmembrane {beta}-barrel families is unknown and experimental structure determination is challenging. In theory, if one knows the number of strands in the {beta}-barrel, then the 3D structure of the barrel could be trivial, but current topology predictions do not predict accurate structures and are unable to give information beyond the {beta}-strands in the barrel. Recent work has shown successful prediction of globular and alpha-helical membrane proteins from sequence alignments, by using high ranked evolutionary couplings between residues as distance constraints to fold extended polypeptides. However, these methods, have not addressed the calculation of precise {beta}-sheet hydrogen bonding that defines transmembrane {beta}-barrels, and would be required to fold these proteins successfully. Hence we developed a method (EVFold_BB) that can successfully model transmembrane {beta}-barrels by combining evolutionary couplings together with topology predictions. EVFold_BB is validated by the accurate all-atom 3D modeling of 18 proteins, representing all known membrane {beta}-barrel families that have sufficient sequences available. To demonstrate the potential of our approach we predict the unknown 3D structure of the LptD protein, the plausibility of its accuracy is supported by the blindly predicted benchmarks, and is consistent with experimental observations. Our approach can naturally be extended to all unknown {beta}-barrel proteins with sufficient sequence information.\n",
      "Balancing selection maintains advantageous genetic and phenotypic diversity in populations. When selection acts for long evolutionary periods selected polymorphisms may survive species splits and segregate in present-day populations of different species. Here, we investigated the role of long-term balancing selection in the evolution of protein-coding sequences in the Pan-Homo clade. We sequenced the exome of 20 humans, 20 chimpanzees and 20 bonobos and detected eight coding trans-species polymorphisms (trSNPs) that are shared among the three species and have segregated for approximately 14 million years of independent evolution. While the majority of these trSNPs were found in three genes of the MHC cluster, we also uncovered one coding trSNP (rs12088790) in the gene LAD1. All these trSNPs show clustering of sequences by allele rather than by species and also exhibit other signatures of long-term balancing selection, such as segregating at intermediate frequency and lying in a locus with high genetic diversity. Here we focus on the trSNP in LAD1, a gene that encodes for Ladinin-1, a collagenous anchoring filament protein of basement membrane that is responsible for maintaining cohesion at the dermal-epidermal junction; the gene is also an autoantigen responsible for linear IgA disease. This trSNP results in a missense change (Leucine257Proline) and, besides altering the protein sequence, is associated with changes in gene expression of LAD1.\n",

      "Parkinson's disease is associated with mitochondrial decline in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. One of the genes, DJ- 1/PARK7, linked with the onset of Parkinson's disease, belongs to a novel glyoxalase family and influences mitochondrial activity. It has been assumed that glyoxalases fulfill this task by detoxifying aggressive aldehyde by-products of metabolism. Here we show that supplying either D-lactate or glycolate, products of DJ-1, rescues the requirement for the enzyme in maintenance of mitochondrial potential. We further show that glycolic acid and D-lactic acid can elevate lowered mitochondrial membrane potential caused by silencing PINK-1, another Parkinson's related gene, as well as by paraquat, an environmental toxin known to be linked with Parkinson's disease. We propose that DJ-1 and consequently its products are components of a novel pathway that stabilizes mitochondria during cellular stress. We go on to show that survival of cultured mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons, defective in Parkinson's disease, is enhanced by glycolate and D-lactate. Because glycolic and D-lactic acids occur naturally, they are therefore a potential therapeutic route for treatment or prevention of Parkinson's disease.\n",
      "The conserved CUGBP1, Elav-like (CELF) family of RNA binding proteins contribute to heart and skeletal muscle development and are implicated in myotonic dystrophy (DM). To understand genome-wide functions of CELF proteins, we analyzed transcriptome dynamics following induction of CELF1 or CELF2 in adult mouse heart or CELF1 in muscle by RNA-seq, complemented by crosslinking/immunoprecipitation-sequencing (CLIP-seq) analysis of mouse cells and tissues to distinguish direct from indirect regulatory targets. Analysis of expression and mRNA binding data revealed hundreds of mRNAs bound in their 3' UTRs by both CELF1 and and the developmentally induced Mbnl1 protein, 3-fold more than expected. The relative extent of CELF1 and Mbnl1 binding in 3' UTRs predicted the extent of repression or stabilization, respectively, following CELF induction. These findings support a ?Cytoplasmic Competition? model in which CELF and Mbnl proteins compete to specify degradation or membrane localization/stabilization, respectively, of an overlapping set of targets. Several hundred messages contained proximal CELF1 and Mbnl1 binding sites (within 50 bases), and were more strongly repressed by CELF1 than messages with distal sites. Messages with different spacing of CELF and Mbnl sites in their 3' UTRs exhibited different developmental dynamics, suggesting that spacing is used to tune cytoplasmic competition between these factors to specify the timing of developmental induction. CELF1 also shared dozens of splicing targets with Mbnl1, most regulated oppositely, confirming a phenomenon observed in smaller scale studies but not previously supported by genome-wide methods, which also appears to enhance developmental transitions.\n",
      "While population-level genomic sequence data have been gathered extensively for humans, similar data from our closest living relatives are just beginning to emerge. Examination of genomic variation within great apes offers many opportunities to increase our understanding of the forces that have differentially shaped the evolutionary history of hominid taxa. Here, we expand upon the work of the Great Ape Genome Project by analyzing medium to high coverage whole genome sequences from 14 western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla), 2 eastern lowland gorillas (G. beringei graueri), and a single Cross River individual (G. gorilla diehli). We infer that the ancestors of western and eastern lowland gorillas diverged from a common ancestor [~]261 thousand years ago (kya), and that the ancestors of the Cross River population diverged from the western lowland gorilla lineage [~]68 kya. Using a diffusion approximation approach to model the genome-wide site frequency spectrum, we infer a history of western lowland gorillas that includes an ancestral population expansion of [~]1.4-fold around [~]970 kya and a recent [~]5.6-fold contraction in population size [~]23 kya. The latter may correspond to a major reduction in African equatorial forests around the Last Glacial Maximum. We also analyze patterns of variation among western lowland gorillas to identify several genomic regions with strong signatures of recent selective sweeps. We find that processes related to taste, pancreatic and saliva secretion, sodium ion transmembrane transport, and cardiac muscle function are overrepresented in genomic regions predicted to have experienced recent positive selection.\n",
      "The siphonophore Nanomia bijuga is a pelagic hydrozoan (Cnidaria) with complex morphological organization. Each siphonophore is made up of many asexually produced, genetically identical zooids that are functionally specialized and morphologically distinct. These zooids predominantly arise by budding in two growth zones, and are arranged in precise patterns. This study describes the cellular anatomy of several zooid types as well as of the stem and gas-filled float, called the pneumatophore. The distribution of cellular morphologies across zooid types enhances our understanding of zooid function. The unique absorptive cells in the palpon, for example, indicate specialized intracellular digestive processing in this zooid type. Furthermore, there are multiple areas of both endodermal and ectodermal epithelial complexity. Though cnidarians are usually thought of as mono-epithelial, we characterize at least two cellular populations in this species which are not connected to a basement membrane. This work provides a greater understanding of epithelial diversity within the cnidarians, and will be a foundation for future studies on Nanomia bijuga, including functional assays and gene expression analyses.\n",

      "Gaseous neurotransmitters such as nitric oxide (NO) provide a unique and often overlooked mechanism for neurons to communicate through diffusion within a network, independent of synaptic connectivity. NO provides homeostatic control of intrinsic excitability. Here we conduct a theoretical investigation of the distinguishing roles of NO-mediated diffusive homeostasis in comparison with canonical non-diffusive homeostasis in cortical networks. We find that both forms of homeostasis provide a robust mechanism for maintaining stable activity following perturbations. However, the resulting networks differ, with diffusive homeostasis maintaining substantial heterogeneity in activity levels of individual neurons, a feature disrupted in networks with non-diffusive homeostasis. This results in networks capable of representing input heterogeneity, and linearly responding over a broader range of inputs than those undergoing non-diffusive homeostasis. We further show that these properties are preserved when homeostatic and Hebbian plasticity are combined. These results suggest a mechanism for dynamically maintaining neural heterogeneity, and expose computational advantages of non-local homeostatic processes.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNeural firing rates must be maintained within a stable range in the face of ongoing fluctuations in synaptic connectivity. Existing cortical network models achieve this through various homeostatic mechanisms which constrain the excitability of individual neurons according to their recent activity. Here, we propose a new mechanism, diffusive homeostasis, in which neural excitability is modulated by nitric oxide, a gas which can flow freely across cell membranes. Information about a neurons firing rate can be carried by nitric oxide, meaning that an individual neurons excitability is affected by neighboring neurons firing rates as well as its own. We find that this allows a neuron to deviate from the target population activity, as its neighbors will counteract this deviation, thus maintaining stable average activity. This form of neural heterogeneity is more flexible than assigning different target firing rates to individual neurons.\n",

      "Biological and biomedical research relies on comprehensive understanding of protein-coding transcripts. However, the total number of human proteins is still unknown due to the prevalence of alternative splicing and is much larger than the number of human genes.\\n\\nIn this paper, we detected 31,566 novel transcripts with coding potential by filtering our ab initio predictions with 50 RNA-seq datasets from diverse tissues/cell lines. PCR followed by MiSeq sequencing showed that at least 84.1% of these predicted novel splice sites could be validated. In contrast to known transcripts, the expression of these novel transcripts were highly tissue-specific. Based on these novel transcripts, at least 36 novel proteins were detected from shotgun proteomics data of 41 breast samples. We also showed L1 retrotransposons have a more significant impact on the origin of new transcripts/genes than previously thought. Furthermore, we found that alternative splicing is extraordinarily widespread for genes involved in specific biological functions like protein binding, nucleoside binding, neuron projection, membrane organization and cell adhesion. In the end, the total number of human transcripts with protein-coding potential was estimated to be at least 204,950.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe identification of all human proteins is an important and open problem. In this report we first develop an ab initio predictor to collect candidate gene models as many as possible. Next, comprehensive sets of RNA-seq data from diverse tissues and cell lines are used to select confident transcripts. Experimental validation of a subset of predictions confirms a high accuracy for the predicted coding transcript set and has added about 30,000 new protein-coding transcripts to the existing corpus of knowledge in this area. This is significant progress given that the existing protein-coding transcript number in public databases is about 60,000. Our newly found transcripts are more tissue specific. Based on our results, we show that L1's high impact on gene origin and genes with high number of transcripts are enriched in specific functions. At last, we estimate that the total number of human protein-coding transcripts is in excess of 200,000.\n",

Based on these novel transcripts, at least 36 novel proteins were detected from shotgun proteomics data of 41 breast samples. We also showed L1 retrotransposons have a more significant impact on the origin of new transcripts/genes than previously thought. Furthermore, we found that alternative splicing is extraordinarily widespread for genes involved in specific biological functions like protein binding, nucleoside binding, neuron projection, membrane organization and cell adhesion. In the end, the total number of human transcripts with protein-coding potential was estimated to be at least 204,950.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe identification of all human proteins is an important and open problem. In this report we first develop an ab initio predictor to collect candidate gene models as many as possible. Next, comprehensive sets of RNA-seq data from diverse tissues and cell lines are used to select confident transcripts. Experimental validation of a subset of predictions confirms a high accuracy for the predicted coding transcript set and has added about 30,000 new protein-coding transcripts to the existing corpus of knowledge in this area. This is significant progress given that the existing protein-coding transcript number in public databases is about 60,000. Our newly found transcripts are more tissue specific. Based on our results, we show that L1's high impact on gene origin and genes with high number of transcripts are enriched in specific functions. At last, we estimate that the total number of human protein-coding transcripts is in excess of 200,000.\n",
      "Perception of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by cell surface localized pattern recognition receptors (PPRs), activates plant basal defense responses in a process known as PAMP/PRR-triggered immunity (PTI). In turn, pathogens deploy effector proteins that interfere with different steps in PTI signaling. However, our knowledge of PTI suppression by filamentous plant pathogens, i.e. fungi and oomycetes, remains fragmentary. Previous work revealed that BAK1/SERK3, a regulatory receptor of several PRRs, contributes to basal immunity against the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans. Moreover BAK1/SERK3 is required for the cell death induced by P. infestans elicitin INF1, a protein with characteristics of PAMPs. The P. infestans host-translocated RXLR-WY effector AVR3a is known to supress INF1-mediated defense by binding the E3 ligase CMPG1. In contrast, AVR3aKl-Y147del, a deletion mutant of the C-terminal tyrosine of AVR3a, fails to bind CMPG1 and suppress INF1 cell death. Here we studied the extent to which AVR3a and its variants perturb additional BAK1/SERK3 dependent PTI responses using the plant PRR FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2). We found that all tested variants of AVR3a, including AVR3aKl-Y147del, suppress early defense responses triggered by the bacterial flagellin-derived peptide flg22 and reduce internalization of activated FLS2 from the plasma membrane without disturbing its nonactivated localization. Consistent with this effect of AVR3a on FLS2 endocytosis, we discovered that AVR3a associates with the Dynamin-Related Protein DRP2, a plant GTPase implicated in receptor-mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, DRP2 is required for ligand-induced FLS2 internalization but does not affect internalization of the growth receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1). Furthermore, overexpression of DRP2 suppressed accumulation of reactive oxygen species triggered by PAMP treatment. We conclude that AVR3a associates with a key cellular trafficking and membrane-remodeling complex involved in immune receptor-mediated endocytosis and signaling. AVR3a is a multifunctional effector that can suppress BAK1/SERK3 mediated immunity through at least two different pathways.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYPlants have a basal layer of immunity to mount defense responses against invading pathogens; in turn, pathogens deploy effector proteins to subvert plant immunity and manipulate host processes to enable parasitic infection. The Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans has a large set of effectors that target multiple host cellular sites. The best-characterized P. infestans effector AVR3a supports enhanced infection and suppresses the cell death induced by the P. infestans protein INF1-elicitin. Previous work demonstrated that the plant immunity co-receptor BAK1/SERK3 contributes to basal immunity to P. infestans and that the RXLR-WY effector of P. infestans suppresses BAK1/SERK3-mediated immunity by binding the E3 ligase protein CMPG1. Here we show that AVR3a suppresses additional defense responses mediated by BAK1/SERK3 independently of CMPG1. AVR3a reduces the endocytosis of the plant receptor FLS2, which recognizes the flagellin-derived peptide flg22 in a BAK1/SERK3 dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AVR3a associates with the Dynamin-Related Protein DRP2, a plant GTPase involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis that is required for FLS2 internalization. Our work revealed that AVR3a is a multifunctional effector that perturbs cellular trafficking initiated at the cell periphery by at least two mechanisms, and that this effector associates with a key cellular trafficking and membrane-remodeling complex involved in immune receptor-mediated endocytosis and signaling.\n",

Recently, a nanopore-based sequencing instrument, the Oxford Nanopore MinION, has become available that we used for sequencing the S. cerevisiae genome. To make use of these data, we developed a novel open-source hybrid error correction algorithm Nanocorr (https://github.com/jgurtowski/nanocorr) specifically for Oxford Nanopore reads, as existing packages were incapable of assembling the long read lengths (5-50kbp) at such high error rate (between [~]5 and 40% error). With this new method we were able to perform a hybrid error correction of the nanopore reads using complementary MiSeq data and produce a de novo assembly that is highly contiguous and accurate: the contig N50 length is more than ten-times greater than an Illumina-only assembly (678kb versus 59.9kbp), and has greater than 99.88% consensus identity when compared to the reference. Furthermore, the assembly with the long nanopore reads presents a much more complete representation of the features of the genome and correctly assembles gene cassettes, rRNAs, transposable elements, and other genomic features that were almost entirely absent in the Illumina-only assembly.\\n\\nReviewer link to datahttp://schatzlab.cshl.edu/data/nanocorr/\n",

      "The folding of most integral membrane proteins follows a two-step process: Initially, individual transmembrane helices are inserted into the membrane by the Sec translocon. Thereafter, these helices fold to shape the final conformation of the protein. However, for some proteins, including Aquaporin 1 (AQP1), the folding appears to follow a more complicated path. AQP1 has been reported to first insert as a four-helical intermediate, where helix 2 and 4 are not inserted into the membrane. In a second step this intermediate is folded into a six-helical topology. During this process, the orientation of the third helix is inverted. Here, we propose a mechanism for how this reorientation could be initiated: First, helix 3 slides out from the membrane core resulting in that the preceding loop enters the membrane. The final conformation could then be formed as helix 2, 3 and 4 are inserted into the membrane and the reentrant regions come together. We find support for the first step in this process by showing that the loop preceding helix 3 can insert into the membrane. Further, hydrophobicity curves, experimentally measured insertion efficiencies and MD-simulations suggest that the barrier between these two hydrophobic regions is relatively low, supporting the idea that helix 3 can slide out of the membrane core, initiating the rearrangement process\n",
      "The translocon recognizes transmembrane helices with sufficient level of hydrophobicity and inserts them into the membrane. However, sometimes less hydrophobic helices are also recognized. Positive inside rule, orientational preferences of and specific interactions with neighboring helices have been shown to aid in the recognition of these helices, at least in artificial systems. To better understand how the translocon inserts marginally hydrophobic helices, we studied three naturally occurring marginally hydrophobic helices, which were previously shown to require the subsequent helix for efficient translocon recognition. We find no evidence for specific interactions when we scan all residues in the subsequent helices. Instead, we identify arginines located at the N-terminal part of the subsequent helices that are crucial for the recognition of the marginally hydrophobic transmembrane helices, indicating that the positive inside rule is important. However, in two of the constructs these arginines do not aid in the recognition without the rest of the subsequent helix, i.e. the positive inside rule alone is not sufficient. Instead, the improved recognition of marginally hydrophobic helices can here be explained as follows; the positive inside rule provides an orientational preference of the subsequent helix, which in turn allows the marginally hydrophobic helix to be inserted, i.e. the effect of the positive inside rule is stronger if positively charged residues are followed by a transmembrane helix. Such a mechanism can obviously not aid C-terminal helices and consequently we find that the terminal helices in multi-spanning membrane proteins are more hydrophobic than internal helices.\n",
      "BackgroundAnalysing tumour architecture for metastatic potential usually focuses on phenotypic differences due to cellular morphology or specific genetic mutations, but often ignore the cells position within the heterogeneous substructure. Similar disregard for local neighborhood structure is common in mathematical models.\\n\\nMethodsWe view the dynamics of disease progression as an evolutionary game between cellular phenotypes. A typical assumption in this modeling paradigm is that the probability of a given phenotypic strategy interacting with another depends exclusively on the abundance of those strategies without regard local heterogeneities. We address this limitation by using the Ohtsuki-Nowak transform to introduce spatial structure to the go vs. grow game.\\n\\nResultsWe show that spatial structure can promote the invasive (go) strategy. By considering the change in neighbourhood size at a static boundary - such as a blood-vessel, organ capsule, or basement membrane - we show an edge effect that allows a tumour without invasive phenotypes in the bulk to have a polyclonal boundary with invasive cells. We present an example of this promotion of invasive (EMT positive) cells in a metastatic colony of prostate adenocarcinoma in bone marrow.\\n\\nInterpretationPathologic analyses that do not distinguish between cells in the bulk and cells at a static edge of a tumour can underestimate the number of invasive cells. We expect our approach to extend to other evolutionary game models where interaction neighborhoods change at fixed system boundaries.\n",
      "AbstractCurrent strategies to improve graft outcome following kidney transplantation consider information at the HLA loci. Here, we used exome sequencing of DNA from ABO compatible kidney graft recipients and their living donors to determine recipient and donor mismatches at the amino acid level over entire exomes. We estimated the number of amino acid mismatches in transmembrane proteins, more likely to be seen as foreign by the recipients immune system, and designated this tally as the allogenomics mismatch score (AMS). The AMS can be measured prior to transplantation with DNA for potential donor and recipient pairs. We examined the degree of relationship between the AMS and post-transplantation kidney allograft function by linear regression. In a discovery cohort, we found a significant inverse correlation between the AMS and kidney graft function at 36 months post-transplantation (n=10 recipient/donor pairs; 20 exomes) (r2>=0.57, P<0.05). The predictive ability of the AMS persists when the score is restricted to regions outside of the HLA loci. This relationship was validated using an independent cohort of 24 recipient donor pairs (n=48 exomes) (r2>=0.39, P<0.005). In an additional cohort of living and mostly intra-familial recipient/donor pairs (n=19, 38 exomes), we validated the association after controlling for donor age at time of transplantation. Finally, a model that controls for donor age, HLA mismatches and time post-transplantation yields a consistent AMS effect across these three independent cohorts (P<0.05). Taken together, these results show that the AMS is a strong predictor of long-term graft function in kidney transplant recipients.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryPrediction of long-term kidney graft function with exome sequencing\n",

      "Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) forms a membranous network that extends throughout neurons. SER regulates intracellular calcium and the posttranslational modification and trafficking of membrane and proteins. As the structure of dendritic SER shifts from a tubular to a more complex, branched form, the movement of membrane cargo slows and delivery to nearby spines increases. Here we discovered changes in the structural complexity of SER that have important functional implications during long-term potentiation (LTP) in adult rat hippocampus. By 2 hours after the induction of LTP with theta-burst stimulation, synapse enlargement was greatest on spines that contained SER. More spines had an elaborate spine apparatus than a simple tubule of SER. The SER in dendritic shafts became more complex beneath spines with both polyribosomes and SER, and less complex along aspiny dendritic regions. The findings suggest that local changes in dendritic SER support enhanced growth of specific synapses during LTP.\n",
      "Initiation of the adaptive immune response is dependent on the priming of naive T cells by APCs. Proteomic analysis of unactivated and activated human NK cell membrane-enriched fractions demonstrated that activated NK cells can efficiently stimulate T cells, since they upregulate MHC class II molecules and multiple ligands for TCR costimulatory molecules. Furthermore, by manipulating antigen administration, we show that NK cells possess multiple independent unique pathways for antigen uptake. These results highlight NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and specific ligand recognition by cell surface-activating receptors on NK cells as unique mechanisms for antigen capturing and presentation. In addition, we analyzed the T cell-activating potential of human NK cells derived from different clinical conditions, such as inflamed tonsils and noninfected and CMV-infected uterine decidual samples, and from transporter-associated processing antigen 2-deficient patients. This in vivo analysis revealed that proinflammatory, but not immune-suppressive, microenvironmental requirements can selectively dictate upregulation of T cell-activating molecules on NK cells. Taken together, these observations offer new and unexpected insights into the direct interactions between NK and T cells and suggest novel APC-like activating functions for human NK cells.\\n\\nNonstandard abbreviations used\n",

Here, we show that the CTP1 transit peptide is necessary and sufficient for accumulation in the stroma of chloroplasts, and is cleaved after translocation.

We draw an analogy between essential cancer proteins and well-known Abraham Walds work on estimating the plane critical areas using data on survivability of aircraft encountering enemy fire. Wald reasoned that parts hit least on the returned planes are critical and should be protected more. Similarly we propose that genes essential for tumor cell should carry less high-impact mutations in cancer compared to polymorphisms found in normal cells.\\n\\nResultsWe used data on mutations from the Cancer Genome Atlas and polymorphisms found in healthy humans (from 1000 Genomes Project) to predict 91 protein-coding genes essential for melanoma. These genes were selected according to several criteria including negative selection, expression in melanocytes and decrease in the proportion of high-impact mutations in cancer compared with normal cells.\\n\\nGene ontology analysis revealed enrichment of essential proteins related to membrane and cell periphery. We speculate that this could be a sign of immune system-driven negative selection of cancer neo-antigens. Another finding is overrepresentation of semaphorin receptors, which can mediate distinctive signaling cascades and are involved in various aspects of tumor development. Cytokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR1 were also identified as cancer essential proteins and this is confirmed by other studies.\\n\\nConclusionsOverall our goal was to illustrate the idea of detecting proteins whose sequence integrity and functioning is important for cancer cell survival. Hopefully, this prediction of essential cancer proteins may point to new targets for anti-tumor therapies.\n",
      "We surveyed gene expression in six tissues in an F2 intercross between mouse strains C57BL/6J (abbreviated B6) and BTBR T+ tf /J (abbreviated BTBR) made genetically obese with the Leptin(ob) mutation. We identified a number of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) affecting the expression of numerous genes distal to the locus, called trans-eQTL hotspots. Some of these trans-eQTL hotspots showed effects in multiple tissues, whereas some were specific to a single tissue. An unusually large number of transcripts (7% of genes) mapped in trans to a hotspot on chromosome 6, specifically in pancreatic islets. By considering the first two principal components of the expression of genes mapping to this region, we were able to convert the multivariate phenotype into a simple Mendelian trait. Fine-mapping the locus by traditional methods reduced the QTL interval to a 298 kb region containing only three genes, including Slco1a6, one member of a large family of organic anion transporters. Direct genomic sequencing of all Slco1a6 exons identified a non-synonymous coding SNP that converts a highly conserved proline residue at amino acid position 564 to serine. Molecular modeling suggests that Pro564 faces an aqueous pore within this 12-transmembrane domain-spanning protein. When transiently overexpressed in HEK293 cells, BTBR OATP1A6-mediated cellular uptake of the bile acid taurocholic acid (TCA) was enhanced compared to B6 OATP1A6. Our results suggest that genetic variation in Slco1a6 leads to altered transport of TCA (and potentially other bile acids) by pancreatic islets, resulting in broad gene regulation.\n",

      "Eukaryotic cells are defined by compartments through which the trafficking of macromolecules is mediated by large complexes, such as the nuclear pore, transport vesicles and intraflagellar transport. The assembly and maintenance of these complexes is facilitated by endomembrane coatomers, long suspected to be divergently related on the basis of structural and more recently phylogenomic analysis. By performing supervised walks in sequence space across coatomer superfamilies, we uncover subtle sequence patterns that have remained elusive to date, ultimately unifying eukaryotic coatomers by divergent evolution. The conserved residues shared by 3,502 endomembrane coatomer components are mapped onto the solenoid superhelix of nucleoporin and COPII protein structures, thus determining the invariant elements of coatomer architecture. This ancient structural motif can be considered as a universal signature connecting eukaryotic coatomers involved in multiple cellular processes across cell physiology and human disease.\n",
      "The Axon Initial Segment [AIS], located within the first 30 m of the axon, has two essential roles in generating action potentials and maintaining axonal identity. AIS assembly depends on a {beta}IV-spectrin / ankyrin G scaffold, but its macromolecular arrangement is not well understood. Here we quantitatively determined the AIS nanoscale architecture using STo-chastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy [STORM]. First we directly demonstrate that the 190-nm periodicity of the AIS submembrane lattice results from longitudinal, head-to-head {beta}IV-spectrin molecules connecting actin rings. Using multicolor 3D-STORM, we resolve the nanoscale organization of ankyrin G: its aminoterminus associates with the submembrane lattice, whereas the carboxyterminus radially extends (~32 nm on average) toward the cytosol. This AIS nano-architecture is highly resistant to cytoskeletal perturbations, advocating its role in structural stabilization. Our findings provide a comprehensive view of the AIS molecular architecture, and will help understanding the crucial physiological functions of this compartment.\n",

      "The flagellum is a large proteinaceous organelle found at the surface of many bacteria, whose primary role is to allow motility through the rotation of a long extracellular filament. It is an essential virulence factor in many pathogenic species, and is also a priming component in the formation of antibiotic-resistant biofilms. The flagellum consists of the export apparatus and stator in the cytosol; the basal body, spanning the bacterial membrane(s) and periplasm; and the hook-filament, that protrudes away from the bacterial surface. Assembly of the bacterial flagellum is initiated by the formation of the basal body MS ring region, constituted of multiple copies of the protein FliF. Here, I report an analysis of the FliF sequence from various bacterial species, demonstrating that its periplasmic region is composed of a domain homologuous to that of the type III secretion system proteins PrgK, and of a second globular domain that possesses a similar fold to that of the sporulation complex component SpoIIIAG. I also describe that Chlamydia possesses an unusual FliF protein, lacking part of the PrgK homology domain and the SpoIIIAG-like domain, and fused to FliG at its C-terminus. Finally, I have combined the sequence analysis of FliF with the EM map of the MS ring, to propose the first atomic model for the FliF oligomer. These results further emphasize the similarity between the flagellum, T3SS and sporulation complex, and will facilitate further structural studies.\n",

      "Reducing insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) levels or administration of IGF-I show beneficial effects in the brain. We now provide evidence to help resolve this paradox. The unliganded IGF-IR inhibits glucose uptake by astrocytes while its stimulation with IGF-I, in concert with insulin activation of the insulin receptor, produces the opposite effect. In vivo imaging showed that shRNA interference of brain IGF-IR increased glucose uptake by astrocytes while pharmacological blockade of IGF-IR reduced it. Brain 18FGlucose-PET of IGF-IR shRNA injected mice confirmed an inhibitory role of unliganded IGF-IR on glucose uptake, whereas glucose-dependent recovery of neuronal activity in brain slices was blunted by pharmacological blockade of IGF-IR. Mechanistically, we found that the unliganded IGF-IR retains glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), the main glucose transporter in astrocytes, inside the cell while IGF-I, in cooperation with insulin, synergistically stimulates MAPK/PKD to promote association of IGF-IR with GLUT 1 via Rac1/GIPC1 and increases GLUT1 availability at the cell membrane. These findings identify IGF-I and its receptor as antagonistic modulators of brain glucose uptake.\n",
      "Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the chemical energy currency of biology, is synthesized in eukaryotic cells primarily by the mitochondrial ATP synthase. ATP synthases operate by a rotary catalytic mechanism where proton translocation through the membrane-inserted Fo region is coupled to ATP synthesis in the catalytic F1 region via rotation of a central rotor subcomplex. We report here single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of the bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase. Combining cryo-EM data with bioinformatic analysis allowed us to determine the fold of the a subunit, suggesting a proton translocation path through the Fo region that involves both the a and b subunits. 3D classification of images revealed seven distinct states of the enzyme that show different modes of bending and twisting in the intact ATP synthase. Rotational fluctuations of the c8-ring within the Fo region support a Brownian ratchet mechanism for proton-translocation driven rotation in ATP synthases.\n",

      "Damage to the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) can lead to diseases for which there are no clearly effective treatments. Since mitochondrial function and biogenesis are controlled by the nutrient environment of the cell, it is possible that perturbation of conserved, nutrient-sensing pathways may successfully treat mitochondrial disease. We found that restricting glucose or otherwise reducing the activity of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway can lead to improved proliferation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking mtDNA and that the transcriptional response to mtDNA loss is reduced in cells with diminished PKA activity. We have excluded many pathways and proteins from being individually responsible for the benefits provided to cells lacking mtDNA by PKA inhibition, and we found that robust import of mitochondrial polytopic membrane proteins may be required in order for cells without mtDNA to receive the full benefits of PKA reduction. Finally, we have discovered that the transcription of genes involved in arginine biosynthesis and aromatic amino acid catabolism is altered after mtDNA damage. Our results highlight the potential importance of nutrient detection and availability on the outcome of mitochondrial dysfunction.\n",

      "Cancer cells have a more hyperpolarised mitochondrial membrane potential ({Psi}IM) than normal cells. {Psi}IM = [~]-220 mV in cancer cells as compared to [~]-140 mV in normal cells. Until now it has not been known why. This paper explains this disparity, in a mathematical framework, and identifies molecular targets and operations unique to cancer cells. These are thence prospective cancer drug targets. BMS-199264 is proposed as an anti-cancer drug. It inhibits the reverse, proton-pumping mode of ATP synthase, which this paper identifies as crucial to cancer cells but not to healthy, normal adult cells. In the cancer cell model, the adenine nucleotide exchanger (ANT) is inversely orientated in the mitochondrial inner membrane as compared to normal cells. This predicts it to have a different drug interaction profile, which can be leveraged for cancer therapy. Uncouplers, which dissipate the proton motive force, are proposed as anti-cancer medicines e.g. 2,4-dinitrophenol.\n",
      "AbstractIsolation of endogenous proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been facilitated by inserting encoding polypeptide affinity tags at the C-termini of chromosomal open reading frames (ORFs) using homologous recombination of DNA fragments. The tagged protein isolation is limited by a number of factors, including high cost of affinity resins for bulk isolation and low concentration of ligands on the resin surface, leading to low isolation efficiencies and trapping of contaminants. To address this we have created a recombinant \\\"CelTag\\\" DNA construct from which PCR fragments can be created to easily tag C-termini of S. cerevisiae ORFs using selection for a nat1 marker. The tag has a C-terminal cellulose binding module to be used in the first affinity step. Microgranular cellulose is very inexpensive and has an effectively continuous ligand on its surface, allowing rapid, highly efficient purification with minimal background in a single step. Cellulose-bound proteins are released by specific cleavage of an included site for TEV protease, giving nearly pure product. The tag can be lifted from the recombinant DNA construct either with or without a 13x myc epitope tag between the target ORF and the TEV protease site. Binding of CelTag protein fusions to cellulose is stable to high salt, nonionic detergents, and 1 M urea, allowing stringent washing conditions to remove loosely associated components, as needed, before specific elution. It is anticipated that this reagent will allow isolation of rare or unstable protein complexes from large quantities of yeast extract, including soluble, membrane-bound, or chromatin-associated assemblies.\n",
      "Unlike passive rupture of the human chorioamnion at birth, the insect extraembryonic (EE) tissues - the amnion and serosa - actively rupture and withdraw in late embryogenesis. Despite its importance for successful development, EE morphogenesis remains poorly understood. Contradicting the hypothesis of a single, fused EE membrane, we show that both tissues persist as discrete epithelia within a bilayer, using new tissue-specific EGFP transgenic lines in the beetle Tribolium castaneum. Quantitative live imaging analyses show that the amnion initiates EE rupture in a specialized anterior-ventral cap, while RNAi manipulation of EE tissue complement and function reveals that the serosa is autonomously contractile. Thus the bilayer efficiently coordinates the amnion as initiator and serosa as driver to achieve withdrawal. The novel bilayer architecture may reflect evolutionary changes in the EE tissues specific to holometabolous insects. More generally, tissue apposition in a bilayer exemplifies a high degree of functional interaction between developing epithelia.\n",
      "Human {gamma}-secretase is an intra-membrane protease that cleaves many different substrates. Aberrant cleavage of Notch is implicated in cancer, while abnormalities in cutting amyloid precursor protein lead to Alzheimers disease. Our previous cryo-EM structure of {gamma}-secretase revealed considerable disorder in its catalytic subunit presenilin. Here, we introduce an image classification procedure that characterizes molecular plasticity at the secondary structure level, and apply this method to identify three distinct conformations in our previous sample. In one of these conformations, an additional transmembrane helix is visible that cannot be attributed to the known components of {gamma}-secretase. In addition, we present a {gamma}-secretase structure in complex with the dipeptidic inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT). Our results reveal how conformational mobility in the second and sixth transmembrane helices of presenilin is greatly reduced upon binding of DAPT or the additional helix, and form the basis for a new model of how substrate enters the transmembrane domain.\n",
      "After heat shock injury, a group of proteins that regulate protein-folding processes are synthesised to prevent damage. Caspase is an enzyme responsible for the execution ostress-induced apoptosis. Heat shock proteins (Hsp) are capable of modulating caspase activity. In addition to changes in protein synthesis, heat shock causes the release of arachidonic acid (AA) from plasma membranes and the subsequent synthesis of eicosanoids, i.e., activation of the AA pathways. The development of cytoprotective strategies might depend on whether caspase-1 activity is affected by heat shock preconditioning and the associated pharmacological modulations after heat shock injury. Therefore, we studied the effects of heat shock preconditioning and modulations of the eicosanoid pathways on Ap-sHSP20.8 and on the final apoptotic effector enzyme caspase-1 to clarify whether these effects were modulated in the fat bodies of Antheraea pernyi injured by heat shock. We concluded that eicosanoid biosynthesis inhibitors might be utilised to simultaneously decrease Hsp 20.8 synthesis and to increase caspase-1 activity. Modifications of the eicosanoid pathways might also be used to mediate caspase-1 activity under hyperthermic conditions, suggesting a novel mechanism for regulation of caspase-1 in the fat bodies of A. pernyi\n",
      "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the causative agent of chronic respiratory infections and is an important pathogen of cystic fibrosis patients. Adaptive mutations play an essential role for antimicrobial resistance and persistence. The factors that contribute to bacterial mutagenesis in this environment are not clear. Recently it has been proposed that cationic antimicrobial peptides such as LL-37 could act as a mutagen in P. aeruginosa. Here we provide experimental evidence that mutagenesis is the product of a joint action of LL-37 and free iron. By estimating mutation rate, mutant frequencies and assessing mutational spectra in P. aeruginosa treated either with LL-37, iron or a combination of both we demonstrate that mutation rate and mutant frequency were increased only when free iron and LL-37 were present simultaneously. The addition of an iron chelator completely abolished this mutagenic effect, suggesting that LL-37 enables iron to enter the cells resulting in DNA damage by Fenton reactions. This was also supported by the observation that the mutational spectrum of the bacteria under LL-37-iron regime showed one of the characteristic Fenton reaction fingerprints: C to T transitions. Free iron concentration in nature and within hosts is kept at a very low level, but the situation in infected lungs of cystic fibrosis patients is different. Intermittent bleeding and damage to the epithelial cells in lungs may contribute to the release of free iron that in turn leads to generation of reactive oxygen species and deterioration of the respiratory tract, making it more susceptible to the infection.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCationic antimicrobial peptides (cAMPs) are small proteins naturally produced by the immune system to limit bacterial growth mainly through pore formation in the membrane. It has recently been suggested that sub-inhibitory concentrations of cAMPs promote bacterial mutagenesis, similarly to antibiotics. However, we previously reported that cAMPs do not increase mutation rate and do not activate bacterial stress responses. Here we resolve this contradiction. We report that free iron in the culture medium increases mutagenesis in the presence of cAMPs. We show that sub-inhibitory concentrations of cAMPs facilitate entry of free iron into bacterial cells, where it interacts with hydrogen peroxide, thereby resulting in production of DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species and increased mutagenesis. Moreover, these results may have clinically-relevant implications: while very little free iron is normally present in healthy individuals, this is not the case in patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, where elevated bacterial mutagenesis promotes antibiotic resistance and contributes to persistence and severity of infection. Thus, an intervention aimed at reduction of free iron in the lungs could reduce the cAMPs-facilitation of iron-mediated mutagenesis; hence antibiotic resistance and pathoadaptation.\n",
      "Actin remodeling is indispensable for dendritic spine development, morphology and density which signify learning, memory and motor skills. CAP2 is a regulator of actin dynamics through sequestering G-actin and severing F-actin. In a mouse model, ablation of CAP2 leads to cardiovascular defects and delayed wound healing. This report investigates the role of CAP2 in the brain using Cap2gt/gt mice. Dendritic spine density and neuronal dendritic length were altered in Cap2gt/gt. This was accompanied by increased F-actin content and F-actin accumulation in cultured Cap2gt/gt neurons. In membrane depolarization assays, Cap2gt/gt synaptosomes exhibit an impaired F/G actin ratio, indicating altered actin dynamics. We show an interaction between CAP2 and n-cofilin, presumably mediated through the C-terminal domain of CAP2 and is cofilin ser3 phosphorylation dependent. In vivo, the consequences of this interaction were altered phosphorylated cofilin levels and formation of cofilin aggregates in the neurons. Thus, our studies identify a novel role of CAP2 in neuronal development and neuronal actin dynamics.\n",
      "Despite advances in sequencing, structural variants (SVs) remain difficult to reliably detect due to the short read length (<300bp) of 2nd generation sequencing. Not only do the reads (or paired-end reads) need to straddle a breakpoint, but repetitive elements often lead to ambiguities in the alignment of short reads. We propose to use the long-reads (up to 20kb) possible with 3rd generation sequencing, specifically nanopore sequencing on the MinION. Nanopore sequencing relies on a similar concept to a Coulter counter, reading the DNA sequence from the change in electrical current resulting from a DNA strand being forced through a nanometer-sized pore embedded in a membrane. Though nanopore sequencing currently has a relatively high mismatch rate that precludes base substitution and small frameshift mutation detection, its accuracy is sufficient for SV detection because of its long reads. In fact, long reads in some cases may improve SV detection efficiency.\\n\\nWe have tested nanopore sequencing to detect a series of well-characterized SVs, including large deletions, inversions, and translocations that inactivate the CDKN2A/p16 and SMAD4/DPC4 tumor suppressor genes in pancreatic cancer. Using PCR amplicon mixes, we have demonstrated that nanopore sequencing can detect large deletions, translocations and inversions at dilutions as low as 1:100, with as few as 500 reads per sample. Given the speed, small footprint, and low capital cost, nanopore sequencing could become the ideal tool for the low-level detection of cancer-associated SVs needed for molecular relapse, early detection, or therapeutic monitoring.\n",
      "BackgroundThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of folding for membrane and secreted proteins. Accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR can promote survival by reducing the load of unfolded proteins through upregulation of chaperones and global attenuation of protein synthesis. However, when ER stress is acute or prolonged cells undergo apoptosis. In this study we sought to determine the effect of globally compromised microRNA biogenesis on the UPR and ER stress-induced apoptosis\\n\\nResultsHere we report the role of Dicer-dependent miRNA biogenesis during the UPR and ER stress-induced apoptosis. We show that ER stress-induced caspase activation and apoptosis is attenuated in Dicer deficient fibroblasts. ER stress-mediated induction of GRP78, the key ER resident chaperone, and also HERP, an important component of ER-associated degradation, are significantly increased in Dicer deficient cells. Expression of the BCL-2 family members BIM and MCL1 were significantly higher in Dicer-null fibroblasts. However, ER stress-mediated induction of pro-apoptotic BH3 only protein BIM was compromised in Dicer mutant cells.\\n\\nConclusionsThese observations demonstrate key roles for Dicer in the UPR and implicate miRNAs as critical components of UPR.\n",

      "Mechanics plays a key role in the development of higher organisms. However, working towards an understanding of this relationship is complicated by the fact that it has proven difficult to model the link between local forces generated at the subcellular level, and tissue deformation at the whole-embryo level. Here we propose an approach first developed for lipid bilayers and cell membranes, in which force-generation at the cytoskeletal level only enters the shape mechanics calculation in the form of local changes in preferred tissue curvature. This allows us to formulate the continuum mechanics problem purely in terms of tissue strains. Relaxing the system by lowering its mechanical energy yields global morphogenetic predictions that accommodate the tendency towards this local preferred curvature, without explicitly modeling force-generating mechanisms at the molecular level. Our computational framework, which we call SPHARMMECH, extends a three-dimensional spherical harmonics parameterization known as SPHARM to combine this level of abstraction with a sparse shape representation. The integration of these two principles allows computer simulations to be performed in three dimensions, on highly complex shapes, gene expression patterns, and mechanical constraints.\\n\\nWe demonstrate our approach by modeling mesoderm invagination in the fruit-fly embryo, where local forces generated by the acto-myosin meshwork in the region of the future mesoderm lead to formation of a ventral tissue fold. The process is accompanied by substantial changes in cell shape and long-range cell movements. Applying SPHARM-MECH to whole-embryo live imaging data acquired with light-sheet microscopy reveals significant correlation between calculated and observed tissue movements. Our analysis predicts the observed cell shape anisotropy on the ventral side of the embryo and suggests an active mechanical role of mesoderm invagination in supporting the onset of germ-band extension.\n",

      "The refractile (R) bodies found in Caedibacter taeniospiralis, a bacterial endosymbiont of Paramecium tetraurelia, are large, polymeric protein structures that can switch between two conformations. At cytoplasmic pH, they resemble coiled ribbons of protein 500nm in diameter. At low pH, they extend to form hollow needles up to 20 microns long. They can be expressed heterologously from an operon containing four short open reading frames and can function in vitro in diverse buffer conditions.\\n\\nIn this study, R bodies purified from Escherichia coli were found to be capable of undergoing many consecutive extension-contraction cycles. Furthermore, the solubility of R bodies, which can easily be interpreted by eye, was found to correlate with their extension state. This macroscopic phenotype was used to develop a quantitative, high-throughput assay for R body state, enabling a visual screen of R body mutants defective in extension. The role of specific amino acids in extension was determined, and this information was used to construct rationally-designed mutants tailored to extend at higher pH. Furthermore, R bodies were able to rupture E. coli spheroplasts to release soluble proteins across lipid bilayers. Taken together, these results show that R bodies act as tunable, pH-actuated pistons suitable for a variety of membrane-breaking applications.\n",

      "While eukaryotic noncoding RNAs have recently received intense scrutiny, it is becoming clear that bacterial transcription is at least as pervasive. Bacterial small RNAs and antisense RNAs (sRNAs) are often assumed to be noncoding, due to their lack of long open reading frames (ORFs). However, there are numerous examples of sRNAs encoding for small proteins, whether or not they also have a regulatory role at the RNA level. Here, we apply flexible machine learning techniques based on sequence features and comparative genomics to quantify the prevalence of sRNA ORFs under natural selection to maintain protein-coding function in phylogenetically diverse bacteria. A majority of annotated sRNAs have at least one ORF between 10 and 50 amino acids long, and we conservatively predict that 188{+/-}25.5 unannotated sRNA ORFs are under selection to maintain coding, an average of 13 per species considered here. This implies that overall at least 7.5 {+/-}0.3% of sRNAs have a coding ORF, and in some species at least 20% do. 84 {+/-} 9.8 of these novel coding ORFs have some antisense overlap to annotated ORFs. As experimental validation, many of our predictions are translated according to ribosome profiling data and are identified via mass spectrometry shotgun proteomics. B. subtilis sRNAs with coding ORFs are enriched for high expression in biofilms and confluent growth, and two S. pneumoniae sRNAs with coding ORFs are involved in virulence. sRNA coding ORFs are enriched for transmembrane domains and many are novel components of type I toxin/antitoxin systems. Our predictions for sRNA coding ORFs, including novel type I toxins, are freely available in a user-friendly format at http://disco-bac.web.pasteur.fr.\n",
      "Spatial aggregation or clustering of membrane proteins could be important for their functionality, e.g., in signaling, and nanoscale imaging can be used to study its origins, structure and function. Such studies require accurate characterization of clusters, both for absolute quantification and hypothesis testing. A set of model-free quantification approaches -- free of specific cluster models-- have been proposed for this purpose. They include the radius of maximal aggregation ra obtained from the maxima of the empirical Besag L(r) - r function as an estimator of cluster size, and the estimation of various cluster parameters based on an exponential approximation for the Pair Correlation Function(PCF). However, the parameter identifiability and bias and scaling due to their model-free nature are not clear. In practice, the clusters might exhibit specific patterns, and the behavior of these estimators in such cases must be studied. Here, we theoretically analyze these approaches for a set of cluster models, and obtain information about their identifiability and bias. We find that the ratio between ra and true cluster size depends on both the true size as well as the number of clusters per unit area, or other corresponding parameters, in a model-dependent manner. In particular, ra scales with respect to the true size by a factor that can be arbitrarily large, depending on models and parameter values. For the method based on PCF approximation, for most models we analyzed, the ratios between approximate and true model parameters were found to be constants that depend only on models and independent of other parameters. For the models analyzed, this ratio was within {+/-}100%. Our theoretical approach was validated by means of simulations. We also discuss some general issues in inference using second-order spatial properties. While precision could also be key, such information on identifiability and accuracy provides clarity on estimation, can lead to better inference, and can also fuel more accurate method development.\n",

      "We present a dynamical model of drug accumulation in bacteria. The model captures key features in experimental time courses on ofloxacin accumulation: initial uptake; two-phase response; and long-term acclimation. In combination with experimental data, the model provides estimates of import and export rates in each phase, the time of entry into the second phase, and the decrease of internal drug during acclimation. Global sensitivity analysis, local sensitivity analysis, and Bayesian sensitivity analysis of the model provide information about the robustness of these estimates, and about the relative importance of different parameters in determining the features of the accumulation time courses in three different bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The results lead to experimentally testable predictions of the effects of membrane permeability, drug efflux and trapping (e.g., by DNA binding) on drug accumulation. A key prediction is that a sudden increase in ofloxacin accumulation in both E. coli and S. aureus is accompanied by a decrease in membrane permeability.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBacteria live or die depending on how much antibiotic gets inside them.

      "Bacteria with two cell membranes (diderms) have evolved complex systems for protein secretion. These systems were extensively studied in some model bacteria, but the characterisation of their diversity has lagged behind due to lack of standard annotation tools. We built models for accurate identification of protein secretion systems and related appendages in bacteria with LPS-containing outer membranes. They can be used with MacSyFinder (standalone program) or online (http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/cgi-bin/portal.py#forms::txsscan). They include protein profiles and information on the systems composition and genetic organisation. They can be used to search for T1SS-T6SS, T9SS, and accessorily for flagella, Type IV and Tad pili. We identified ~10,000 systems in bacterial genomes, where T1SS and T5SS were by far the most abundant and widespread. The recently described T6SSiii and T9SS were restricted to Bacteroidetes, and T6SSii to Francisella. T2SS, T3SS, and T4SS were frequently encoded in single-copy in one locus, whereas most T1SS were encoded in two loci. The secretion systems of diderm Firmicutes were similar to those found in other diderms. Novel systems may remain to be discovered, since some clades of environmental bacteria lacked all known protein secretion systems. Our models can be fully customized, which should facilitate the identification of novel systems.Introduction\n",
      "Beta and gamma rhythms have been hypothesized to be involved in global and local coordination of neuronal activity, respectively. Here, we investigated how cells in rodent area S1BF are entrained by rhythmic fluctuations at various frequencies within the local area and in connected areas, and how this depends on behavioral state and cell type. We performed simultaneous extracellular field and unit recordings in four connected areas of the freely moving rat (S1BF, V1M, perirhinal cortex, CA1). S1BF spiking activity was strongly entrained by both beta and gamma S1BF oscillations, which were associated with deactivations and activations, respectively. We identified multiple classes of fast spiking and excitatory cells in S1BF, which showed prominent differences in rhythmic entrainment and in the extent to which phase locking was modulated by behavioral state. Using an additional dataset acquired by whole-cell recordings in head-fixed mice, these cell classes could be compared with identified phenotypes showing gamma rhythmicity in their membrane potential. We next examined how S1BF cells were entrained by rhythmic fluctuations in connected brain areas. Gamma-synchronization was detected in all four areas, however we did not detect significant gamma coherence among these areas. Instead, we only found long-range coherence in the theta-beta range among these areas. In contrast to local S1BF synchronization, we found long-range S1BF-spike to CA1-LFP synchronization to be homogeneous across inhibitory and excitatory cell types. These findings suggest distinct, cell-type contributions of low and high-frequency synchronization to intra- and inter-areal neuronal interactions.\n",

      "Along with the development of several large-scale methods such as mass spectrometry or micro arrays, genome wide models became not only a possibility but an obvious tool for theoretical biologists to integrate and analyse complex biological data. Nevertheless, incorporating the dynamics of photosynthesis remains one of the major challenges while reconstructing metabolic networks of plants and other photosynthetic organisms. In this review, we aim to provide arguments that small-scale models are still a suitable choice when it comes to discover organisational principles governing the design of biological systems. We give a brief overview of recent modelling efforts in understanding the interplay between rapid, photoprotective mechanisms and the redox balance within the thylakoid membrane, discussing the applicability of a reductionist approach in modelling self-regulation in plants, and outline possible directions for further research.\n",
      "Cortical networks exhibit \\\"global oscillations\\\", in which neural spike times are entrained to an underlying oscillatory rhythm, but where individual neurons fire irregularly, on only a fraction of cycles. While the network dynamics underlying global oscillations have been well characterised, their function is debated. Here, we show that such global oscillations are a direct consequence of optimal efficient coding in spiking networks with synaptic delays. To avoid firing unnecessary spikes, neurons need to share information about the network state. Ideally, membrane potentials should be strongly correlated and reflect a \\\"prediction error\\\" while the spikes themselves are uncorrelated and occur rarely. We show that the most efficient representation is achieved when: (i) spike times are entrained to a global Gamma rhythm (implying a consistent representation of the error); but (ii) few neurons fire on each cycle (implying high efficiency), while (iii) excitation and inhibition are tightly balanced. This suggests that cortical networks exhibiting such dynamics are tuned to achieve a maximally efficient population code.\n",

These domains are present in either eukaryotic peripheral membrane or transmembrane proteins and are responsible for the non-covalent interactions of these proteins with membrane lipids.

      "The transmembrane semaphorin, Sema6A, has important roles in axon guidance, cell migration and neuronal connectivity in multiple regions of the nervous system, mediated by context-dependent interactions with plexin receptors, PlxnA2 and PlxnA4. Here, we demonstrate that Sema6A can also signal cell-autonomously, in two modes, constitutively, or in response to higher-order clustering mediated by either PlxnA2-binding or chemically induced multimerisation. Sema6A activation stimulates recruitment of Abl to the cytoplasmic domain of Sema6A and phosphorylation of this cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, as well as phosphorylation of additional cytoskeletal regulators. Sema6A reverse signaling affects the surface area and cellular complexity of non-neuronal cells and aggregation and neurite formation of primary neurons in vitro. Sema6A also interacts with PlxnA2 in cis, which reduces binding by PlxnA2 of Sema6A in trans but not vice versa. These experiments reveal the complex nature of Sema6A biochemical functions and the molecular logic of the context-dependent interactions between Sema6A and PlxnA2.\n",
      "Chronic Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction (CIPO) is a rare, but life-threatening, disease characterized by severe intestinal dysmotility. Histopathological studies of CIPO patients have identified several different mechanisms that appear to be responsible for the dysmotility, including defects in neurons, smooth muscle or interstitial cells of Cajal. Currently there are few mouse models of the various forms of CIPO. We generated a mouse with a point mutation in the RNA Recognition Motif of the Nup35 gene, which encodes a component of the nuclear pore complex. Nup35 mutants developed a severe megacolon and exhibited reduced lifespan. Histopathological examination revealed a degenerative myopathy that developed after birth and specifically affected smooth muscle in the colon; smooth muscle in the small bowel and the bladder were not affected. Furthermore, no defects were found in enteric neurons or interstitial cells of Cajal. Nup35 mice are likely to be a valuable model for the sub-type of CIPO characterized by degenerative myopathy. Our study also raises the possibility that Nup35 polymorphisms could contribute to some cases of CIPO.\\n\\nSignificance StatementChronic Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction (CIPO) is a disabling bowel disorder in which the symptoms resemble those caused by mechanical obstruction, but no physical obstruction is present. Some patients with CIPO have defects in intestinal neurons while in other CIPO patients the muscle cells in the bowel wall appear to degenerate, but the underlying cause of these defects is unknown in most CIPO patients. We generated a mouse that has a mutation in Nup35, which encodes a component of the pores found within the membrane of the cell nucleus. The mutant mice developed intestinal obstruction, which we showed was due to degeneration of the muscle cells in the colon. This mouse is likely to provide new insights into some forms of CIPO.\n",
      "The cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) is a macromolecular complex that facilitates the supply of release-ready synaptic vesicles to support neurotransmitter release at synapses. To reveal the dynamics of this supply process in living synapses, we used super-resolution imaging to track single vesicles at voltage-clamped presynaptic terminals of retinal bipolar neurons, whose CAZ contains a specialized structure--the synaptic ribbon--that supports both fast, transient and slow, sustained modes of transmission. We find that the synaptic ribbon serves a dual function as a conduit for diffusion of synaptic vesicles and a platform for vesicles to fuse distal to the plasma membrane itself, via compound fusion. The combination of these functions allows the ribbon-type CAZ to achieve the continuous transmitter release required by synapses of neurons that carry tonic, graded visual signals in the retina.\n",

      "Overexpression of SPARC, a collagen-binding glycoprotein, is strongly associated with tumor invasion through extracellular matrix in many aggressive cancers. SPARC regulates numerous cellular processes including integrin-mediated cell adhesion, cell signaling pathways, and extracellular matrix assembly; however, the mechanism by which SPARC promotes cell invasion in vivo remains unclear. A main obstacle in understanding SPARC function has been the difficulty of visualizing and experimentally examining the dynamic interactions between invasive cells, extracellular matrix and SPARC in native tissue environments. Using the model of anchor cell invasion through the basement membrane (BM) extracellular matrix in Caenorhabditis elegans, we find that SPARC overexpression is highly pro-invasive and rescues BM transmigration in mutants with defects in diverse aspects of invasion, including cell polarity, invadopodia formation, and matrix metalloproteinase expression. By examining BM assembly, we find that overexpression of SPARC specifically decreases levels of BM type IV collagen, a crucial structural BM component. Reduction of type IV collagen mimicked SPARC overexpression and was sufficient to promote invasion. Tissue-specific overexpression and photobleaching experiments revealed that SPARC acts extracellularly to inhibit collagen incorporation into BM. By reducing endogenous SPARC, we also found that SPARC functions normally to traffic collagen from its site of synthesis to tissues that do not express collagen. We propose that a surplus of SPARC disrupts extracellular collagen trafficking and reduces BM collagen incorporation, thus weakening the BM barrier and dramatically enhancing its ability to be breached by invasive cells.\n",
      "In most vertebrate neurons, spikes initiate in the axonal initial segment. When recorded in the soma, they have a surprisingly sharp onset, as if sodium (Na) channels opened abruptly. On the basis of multicompartmental models, this phenomenon has been previously attributed to the progressive sharpening of spikes as they backpropagate from the initiation site to the soma. Here we show in the same models that the biophysical basis of the phenomenon is not backpropagation but critical resistive coupling between the soma and the initial segment. Accordingly, spike initiation results from the interplay between Na current and axial resistive current flowing from axonal initiation site to soma, rather than between local Na and potassium transmembrane currents at the initiation site. The sharp onset of somatic spikes is therefore not an artifact of recording spikes at the incorrect location, but rather the signature that spike initiation does not follow the standard account.\n",

      "Vesicle-like structures containing several to numerous concentric membranes, called multilamellar bodies (MLBs), are present both in animal and plant cells. The origin of MLBs in animal cells has been elucidated partially, while that of plant MLBs is unknown. MLBs in plant cells are present in the cytoplasm, at the interface of cytoplasm and vacuole, and inside vacuoles. This suggests that they become transported from the cytoplasm to the vacuole. The function of plant MLBs thus seems transfer of cellular membranes to the vacuole. Although it is often impossible to discern whether they have a single or a double outer membrane, in some examples a double outer membrane is present. This might suggest autophagic/mitochondrial/plastidial origin. Membrane structures similar to those in MLBs have not been described, apparently, in mitochondria. By contrast, structures similar to MLBs are found in autophagous structures and in degenerating chloroplasts and other plastids. The data might suggest the hypothesis that plant MLBs derive from autophagous structures and/or from plastids.\n",
      "Exosomes are small vesicles that are secreted from metazoan cells and may convey selected membrane proteins and small RNAs to target cells for the control of cell migration, development and metastasis. To study the mechanisms of RNA packaging into exosomes, we devised a purification scheme based on the membrane marker CD63 to isolate a single exosome species secreted from HEK293T cells. Using immunoisolated CD63-containing exosomes we identified a set of microRNAs that are highly enriched with respect to their cellular levels. To explore the biochemical requirements for exosome biogenesis and RNA packaging, we devised a cell-free reaction that recapitulates the species-selective enclosure of miR-223 in isolated membranes supplemented with cytosol. We found that the RNA-binding protein Y-box protein I (YBX1) binds to and is required for the sorting of miR-223 in the cell-free reaction. Furthermore, YBX1 serves an important role in the secretion of miRNAs in exosomes by HEK293T cells.\n",
      "Caenorhabditis elegans senses gentle touch via a mechanotransduction channel formed from the DEG/ENaC proteins MEC-4 and MEC-10. An additional protein, the paraoxonase-like protein MEC-6, is essential for transduction, and previous work suggested that MEC-6 was part of the transduction complex. We found that MEC-6 and a similar protein, POML-1, reside primarily in the endoplasmic reticulum and do not colocalize with MEC-4 on the plasma membrane in vivo. As with MEC-6, POML-1 is needed for touch sensitivity, for the neurodegeneration caused by the mec-4(d) mutation, and for the expression and distribution of MEC-4 in vivo. Both proteins are likely needed for the proper folding or assembly of MEC-4 channels in vivo as measured by FRET. MEC-6 detectably increases the rate of MEC-4 accumulation on the Xenopus oocyte plasma membrane. These results suggest that MEC-6 and POML-1 interact with MEC-4 to facilitate expression and localization of MEC-4 on the cell surface. Thus, MEC-6 and POML-1 act more like chaperones for MEC-4 than channel components.\n",
      "In addition to its role in forming vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the coat protein complex II (COPII) is also responsible for selecting specific cargo proteins to be packaged into COPII transport vesicles. Comparison of COPII vesicle formation in mammalian systems and in yeast suggested that the former employs more elaborate mechanisms for cargo recognition, presumably to cope with a significantly expanded repertoire of cargo that transits the secretory pathway. Using proTGF, the transmembrane precursor of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF), as a model cargo protein, we demonstrate in cell-free assays that at least one auxiliary cytosolic factor is specifically required for the efficient packaging of proTGF into COPII vesicles. Using a knockout HeLa cell line generated by CRISPR/Cas9, we provide functional evidence showing that a transmembrane protein, Cornichon-1 (CNIH), acts as a cargo receptor of proTGF. We show that both CNIH and the auxiliary cytosolic factor(s) are required for efficient recruitment of proTGF to the COPII coat in vitro. Moreover, we provide evidence that the recruitment of cargo protein by the COPII coat precedes and may be distinct from subsequent cargo packaging into COPII vesicles.\\n\\nAbbreviations\n",

Using proTGF, the transmembrane precursor of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF), as a model cargo protein, we demonstrate in cell-free assays that at least one auxiliary cytosolic factor is specifically required for the efficient packaging of proTGF into COPII vesicles. Using a knockout HeLa cell line generated by CRISPR/Cas9, we provide functional evidence showing that a transmembrane protein, Cornichon-1 (CNIH), acts as a cargo receptor of proTGF. We show that both CNIH and the auxiliary cytosolic factor(s) are required for efficient recruitment of proTGF to the COPII coat in vitro. Moreover, we provide evidence that the recruitment of cargo protein by the COPII coat precedes and may be distinct from subsequent cargo packaging into COPII vesicles.\\n\\nAbbreviations\n",
      "Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) reduces oxygen to water and uses the released free energy to pump protons across the membrane, contributing to the transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient that drives ATP synthesis. We have used multiscale reactive molecular dynamics simulations to explicitly characterize (with free energy profiles and calculated rates) the internal proton transport events that enable pumping and chemistry during the A[-&gt;]PR[-&gt;]F transition in the aa3-type CcO. Our results show that proton transport from amino acid residue E286 to both the pump loading site (PLS) and to the binuclear center (BNC) are thermodynamically driven by electron transfer from heme a to the BNC, but that the former (i.e., pumping) is kinetically favored while the latter (i.e., transfer of the chemical proton) is rate-limiting. The calculated rates are in quantitative agreement with experimental measurements. The back flow of the pumped proton from the PLS to E286 and from E286 to the inner side of membrane are prevented by the fast reprotonation of E286 through the D-channel and large free energy barriers for the back flow reactions. Proton transport from E286 to the PLS through the hydrophobic cavity (HC) and from D132 to E286 through the D-channel are found to be strongly coupled to dynamical hydration changes in the corresponding pathways.

      "All obligate intracellular pathogens must exit their host cells in order to propagate and survive as a species; the precise strategies they use have a direct impact on their ability to disseminate within a host, transmit to new hosts, and engage or avoid immune responses. The obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis exits the host cell by two distinct exit strategies, lysis and extrusion. Despite being equally active pathways, lysis and extrusion differ greatly in their mechanisms. The defining characteristics of extrusions, and advantages gained by Chlamydia within this unique double-membrane structure are not well understood. Here, we present data that defines extrusions as being largely devoid of host organelles, comprised mostly of Chlamydia elementary bodies, and containing phosphatidylserine on the outer surface of the extrusion membrane. Towards defining a functional role for extrusions in Chlamydia pathogenesis, we demonstrate that extrusions confer significant infectious advantages for Chlamydia by serving as transient, intracellular-like niches for extracellular Chlamydia, as compared to Chlamydia that would otherwise exit by lysing the host cell. In addition to enhanced survival outside of the host cell, we report the key discovery that chlamydial extrusions can be engulfed by primary bone marrow-derived macrophages, after which they provide a protective microenvironment for Chlamydia. Extrusion-derived Chlamydia were able to stave off macrophage based killing beyond 8 h, and culminated in the release of infectious EB from the macrophage. Based on these findings, we propose a model in which a major outcome of Chlamydia exiting epithelial cells inside extrusions is to hijack macrophages as vehicles for dissemination within the host.\n",

      "Four recent papers from our group exploiting the power of electron cryotomography to produce 3-D reconstructions of intact cells in a near-native state have led to the proposal that an ancient sporulation-like event gave rise to the second membrane in diderm bacteria. Here we review the images of sporulating monoderm and diderm cells which show how sporulation leads to diderm cells. We also review the images of Gram-negative and Gram-positive cell walls that show they are more closely related than previously thought, and explain how this provides critical support for the hypothesis. Mapping the distribution of cell envelope architectures onto the most recent phylogenetic tree of life then leads to the conclusion that the diderm cell plan, and therefore the sporulation-like event that gave rise to it, must be very ancient. One explanation for the biogeologic record is that during the cataclysmic transitions of early Earth, cellular evolution may have gone through a bottleneck where only spores survived (LUCA was a spore).\n",
      "During seed germination sugars and auxin are produced from stored precursors or conjugates respectively and transported to the seedling axis. To elucidate the mode of travel of IAA into the phloem a solution of [3H]indoleacetic acid (IAA), together with [14C]sucrose, was injected in the endosperm cavity harboring the cotyledons of germinating seedlings of Ricinus communis. Phloem exudate from the cut hypocotyl was collected and the radioactivity recorded. Sucrose loading in the phloem was inhibited at higher IAA levels, and the rate of filling of the transient pool(s) was reduced by IAA. IAA was detected within 10 minutes, with the concentration increasing over 30 min and reaching a steady-state by 60 min. The kinetics indicated that phloem loading of IAA involving both an active, carrier-based, and a passive, diffusion-based component, with IAA traveling along a pathway containing an intermediary pool, possibly the protoplasts of mesophyll cells. Phloem loading of IAA was altered by sucrose, K+ and a range of non-specific and IAA-specific analogues and inhibitors in a manner that showed that IAA moves into the phloem from the extra cotyledonary solution by multiple pathways, with a carrier mediated pathway playing a principal role.\\n\\nSummary StatementIndoleacetic acid is transported from the peri-cotyledonary space into the phloem of germinating Ricinus seedlings by both trans-membrane carriers and diffusive pathways, with the cells of the cotyledons forming an intermediate reservoir.\n",
      "Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) are bioactive components of membrane phospholipids and serve as substrates for signaling molecules. LCPUFA can be obtained directly from animal foods or synthesized endogenously from 18 carbon precursors via the FADS2 coded enzyme. Vegans rely almost exclusively on endogenous synthesis to generate LCPUFA and we hypothesized that an adaptive genetic polymorphism would confer advantage. The rs66698963 polymorphism, a 22 bp insertion-deletion within FADS2, is associated with basal FADS1 expression, and coordinated induction of FADS1 and FADS2 in vitro. Here we determined rs66698963 genotype frequencies from 234 individuals of a primarily vegetarian Indian population and 311 individuals from the U.S. A much higher I/I genotype frequency was found in Indians (68%) than in the U.S. (18%). Analysis using 1000 Genomes Project data confirmed our observation, revealing a global I/I genotype of 70% in South Asians, 53% in Africans, 29% in East Asians, and 17% in Europeans. Tests based on population divergence, site frequency spectrum and long-range haplotype consistently point to positive selection encompassing rs66698963 in South Asian, African and some East Asian populations. Basal plasma phospholipid arachidonic acid status was 8% greater in I/I compared to D/D individuals. The biochemical pathway product-precursor difference, arachidonic acid minus linoleic acid, was 31% and 13% greater for I/I and I/D compared to D/D, respectively. Our study is consistent with previous in vitro data suggesting that the insertion allele enhances n-6 LCPUFA synthesis and may confer an adaptive advantage in South Asians because of the traditional plant-based diet practice.\n",
      "Autophagy is a conserved cellular degradation pathway wherein a double membrane vesicle, called as an autophagosome captures longlived proteins, damaged or superfluous organelles and delivers to the lysosome for degradation1. We have identified a novel role for septins in autophagy. Septins are GTP-binding proteins that localize at the bud-neck and are involved in cytokinesis in budding yeast2. We show that septins under autophagy prevalent conditions are majorly localized to the cytoplasm in the form of punctate structures. Further, we report that septins not only localize to pre-autophagosomal structure (PAS) but also to autophagosomes in the form of punctate structures. Interestingly, septins also form small non-canonical rings around PAS during autophagy. Furthermore, we observed that in one of the septin Ts\\\" mutant, cdc10-5, the anterograde trafficking of Atg9 was affected at the non-permissive temperature (NPT). All these results suggest a role of septins in early stages of autophagy during autophagosome formation.\n",

      "Cytokinetic cleavage furrows assemble during anaphase at a site that is dictated by the position of the spindle. The GTPase RhoA promotes contractile ring assembly and furrow ingression during cytokinesis. While many factors that regulate RhoA during cytokinesis have been characterized, the spatiotemporal regulatory logic remains undefined. It is not known whether a local zone of RhoA activity is sufficient to induce furrow formation or whether the spindle modulates furrow assembly through other pathways. Similarly, it is not known whether the entire cortex is responsive to RhoA, nor whether contractile ring assembly is cell cycle regulated. Here, we have developed an optogenetic probe to gain tight spatial and temporal control of RhoA activity in mammalian cells and demonstrate that cytokinetic furrowing is primarily regulated at the level of RhoA activation. Light-mediated recruitment of a RhoGEF domain to the plasma membrane leads to rapid activation of RhoA, leading to assembly of cytokinetic furrows that partially ingress. Furthermore, furrow formation in response to RhoA activation is not spatially or temporally restricted. RhoA activation is sufficient to generate furrows at both the cell equator and at cell poles, in both metaphase and anaphase. Remarkably, furrow formation can be initiated in rounded interphase cells, but not adherent cells. These results indicate RhoA activation is sufficient to induce assembly of functional contractile rings and that cell rounding facilitates furrow formation.\n",

      "The Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway is important for multiple developmental processes and tissue maintenance in adults. Consequently, deregulated signaling is involved in a range of human diseases including cancer and developmental defects. A better understanding of the intricate regulatory mechanism and effect of physiological (active) and pathophysiological (hyperactive) WNT signaling is important for predicting treatment response and developing novel therapies. The constitutively expressed CTNNB1 (commonly and hereafter referred to as {beta}-catenin) is degraded by a destruction complex, composed of amongst other AXIN1 and GSK3. The destruction complex is inhibited during active signaling leading to {beta}-catenin stabilization and induction of {beta}-catenin/TCF target genes. In this study we investigated the mechanism and effect of {beta}-catenin stabilization during active and hyperactive WNT signaling in a combined in silico and in vitro approach. We constructed a Petri net model of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling including main players from the plasma membrane (WNT ligands and receptors), cytoplasmic effectors and the downstream negative feedback target gene AXIN2. We simulated the model with active (i.e. WNT stimulation) and hyperactive (i.e. GSK3 inhibition) signaling, which led to the following observations: 1) A dose- and time-dependent response was observed for both WNT stimulation and GSK3 inhibition. 2) The Wnt-pathway activity was 2-fold higher for GSK3 inhibition compared to WNT stimulation. Both of these observations were corroborated by TCF/LEF luciferase reporter assays. Using this experimentally validated model we simulated the effect of the negative feedback regulator AXIN2 upon WNT stimulation and observed an attenuated {beta}-catenin stabilization. We furthermore simulated the effect of APC inactivating mutations, yielding a stabilization of {beta}-catenin levels comparable to the Wnt-pathway activities observed in colorectal and breast cancer. Our model can be used for further investigation and viable predictions of the role of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling in oncogenesis and development.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryDeregulated Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling is implicated in cancer and developmental defects. In this study we combined in silico and in vitro efforts to investigate the behavior of physiological and pathophysiological WNT signaling. We created a model of Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling that describes the core interactions: receptor activation, inhibition of downstream effectors and an important negative feedback mechanism. Simulations with the model demonstrated the expected dose- and time-dependent response for both conditions, and the Wnt-pathway activity was significantly higher for pathophysiological compared to physiological signaling. These observations were experimentally validated, which allowed us to investigate and predict the effect of the negative feedback and an inactivating cancer mutation on the Wnt-pathway activity. Our model provides mechanistic insight on the different conditions and can easily be extended and used to answer other questions on Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling in the area of cancer research and regenerative medicine.\n",
      "Proteins localized to mitochondria by a carboxyl-terminal tail anchor (TA) play roles in apoptosis, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial protein import. To reveal characteristics of TAs that may be important for mitochondrial targeting, we focused our attention upon the TA of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Fis1 protein. Specifically, we generated a library of Fis1p TA variants fused to the Gal4 transcription factor, then, using next-generation sequencing, revealed which Fis1p TA mutations inhibited membrane insertion and allowed Gal4p activity in the nucleus. Prompted by our global analysis, we subsequently analyzed the ability of individual Fis1p TA mutants to localize to mitochondria. Our findings suggest that the membrane-associated domain of Fis1p TA may be bipartite in nature, and we encountered evidence that the positively charged patch at the carboxyl-terminus of Fis1p is required for both membrane insertion and organelle specificity. Furthermore, lengthening or shortening the Fis1 TA by up to three amino acids did not inhibit mitochondrial targeting, arguing against a model in which TA length directs insertion of TAs at specific organelles. Most importantly, positively charged residues were more acceptable at several positions within the membrane-associated domain of the Fis1p TA than negatively charged residues. These findings, emerging from the first high-resolution analysis of an organelle targeting sequence by deep mutational scanning, provide strong, in vivo evidence that lysine and arginine can \\\"snorkel,\\\" or become stably incorporated within a lipid bilayer by placing terminal charges of their side chains at the membrane interface.\\n\\nAbbreviations\n",

      "Geobacter sulfurreducens uses at least two different pathways to transport electrons out of the inner membrane quinone pool before reducing acceptors beyond the outer membrane. When growing on electrodes poised at oxidizing potentials, the CbcL-dependent pathway operates at or below redox potentials of -0.10 V vs. the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE), while the ImcH-dependent pathway operates only above this value. Here, we provide evidence that G. sulfurreducens also requires different electron transfer proteins for reduction of a wide range of Fe(III)- and Mn(IV)- (oxyhydr)oxides, and must transition from a high- to low-potential pathway during reduction of commonly studied soluble and insoluble metal electron acceptors. Freshly precipitated Fe(III)-(oxyhydr)oxides could not be reduced by mutants lacking the high potential pathway. Aging these minerals by autoclaving did not change their powder X-ray diffraction pattern, but restored reduction by mutants lacking the high-potential pathway. Mutants lacking the low-potential, CbcL-dependent pathway had higher growth yields with both soluble and insoluble Fe(III). Together, these data suggest that the ImcH-dependent pathway exists to harvest additional energy when conditions permit, and CbcL switches on to allow respiration closer to thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. With evidence of multiple pathways within a single organism, the study of extracellular respiration should consider not only the crystal structure or solubility of a mineral electron acceptor, but rather the redox potential, as this variable determines the energetic reward affecting reduction rates, extents, and final microbial growth yields in the environment.\n",

      "The fatty acid composition of membrane glycerolipids is a major determinant of Staphylococcus aureus membrane biophysical properties that impacts key factors in cell physiology including susceptibility to membrane active antimicrobials, pathogenesis, and response to environmental stress. The fatty acids of S. aureus are considered to be a mixture of branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs), which increase membrane fluidity, and straight-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that decrease it. The balance of BCFAs and SCFAs in strains USA300 and SH1000 was affected considerably by differences in the conventional laboratory medium in which the strains were grown with media such as Mueller-Hinton broth and Luria broth resulting in high BCFAs and low SCFAs, whereas growth in Tryptic Soy Broth and Brain-Heart Infusion broth led to reduction in BCFAs and an increase in SCFAs. Straight-chain unsaturated fatty acids (SCUFAs) were not detected. However, when the organism was grown ex vivo in serum, the fatty acid composition was radically different with SCUFAs, which increase membrane fluidity, making up a substantial proportion of the total (<25%) with SCFAs (>37%) and BCFAs (>36%) making up the rest. Staphyloxanthin, an additional major membrane lipid component unique to S. aureus, tended to be greater in content in cells with high BCFAs or SCUFAs. Cells with high staphyloxanthin content had a lower membrane fluidity that was attributed to increased production of staphyloxanthin. S. aureus saves energy and carbon by utilizing host fatty acids for part of its total fatty acids when growing in serum. The fatty acid composition of in vitro grown S. aureus is likely to be a poor reflection of the fatty acid composition and biophysical properties of the membrane when the organism is growing in an infection in view of the role of SCUFAs in staphylococcal membrane composition and virulence.\\n\\nFundingThis work was funded in part by grant 1R15AI099977 to Brian Wilkinson and Craig Gatto and grant 1R15GM61583 to Craig Gatto from the National Institutes of Health\n",

For a better understanding of this membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), it is important to address how prevalent this structure is in different neuronal types, different subcellular compartments, and across different animal species. Here, we investigated the organization of spectrin in a variety of neuronal and glial-cell types. We observed the presence of MPS in all of the tested neuronal types cultured from mouse central and peripheral nervous systems, including excitatory and inhibitory neurons from several brain regions, as well as sensory and motor neurons. Quantitative analyses show that MPS is preferentially formed in axons in all neuronal types tested here: spectrin shows a long-range, periodic distribution throughout all axons, but only appears periodic in a small fraction of dendrites, typically in the form of isolated patches in sub-regions of these dendrites. As in dendrites, we also observed patches of periodic spectrin structures in a small fraction of glial-cell processes in four types of glial cells cultured from rodent tissues. Interestingly, despite its strong presence in the axonal shaft, MPS is absent in most presynaptic boutons, but is present in a substantial fraction of dendritic spine necks, including some projecting from dendrites where such a periodic structure is not observed in the shaft. Finally, we found that spectrin is capable of adopting a similar periodic organization in neurons of a variety of animal species, including Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, Gallus gallus, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens.\n",
      "Mechanisms that ensure the integrity of the nuclear envelope rely on membrane remodeling proteins like the ESCRTs and the AAA ATPase Vps4, which help seal the nuclear envelope at the end of mitosis and prevent the formation of defective nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Here, we show that the integral inner nuclear membrane proteins Heh1 and Heh2 directly bind the ESCRT-III, Snf7, and the ESCRT-II/III chimera, Chm7, in their  open forms. Moreover, Heh1 is required for Chm7-recruitment to the nuclear envelope. As Chm7 accumulates on the nuclear envelope upon blocks to NPC assembly, but not to nuclear transport, interactions between ESCRTs and the Heh proteins might form a biochemically distinct nuclear envelope subdomain that delimits regions of assembling NPCs. Interestingly, deletion of CHM7 suppresses the formation of the storage of improperly assembled NPC compartment prevalent in vps4{Delta} strains. Thus, our data support that the Heh1-dependent recruitment of Chm7 is a key component of a quality control pathway whose local regulation by Vps4 and the transmembrane nup, Pom152, prevents loss of nuclear compartmentalization by defective NPCs.\n",
      "Amongst other cellular functions, the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-III (ESCRT-III) machinery controls nuclear envelope (NE) reformation during mitotic exit by sealing holes in the reforming NE. ESCRT-III also acts to repair this organelle upon migration-induced rupture. The ESCRT-III component CHMP7 is responsible for recruitment of ESCRT-III to the NE. Here, we show that the N-terminus of CHMP7, comprising tandem Winged Helix (WH)-domains, is a membrane-binding module. This activity allows CHMP7 to bind to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), an organelle continuous with the NE, and provides a platform to direct NE-recruitment of ESCRT-III during mitotic exit. Point mutations that disrupt membrane-binding prevent CHMP7 localising to the ER and its subsequent enrichment at the reforming NE. These mutations prevent both assembly of downstream ESCRT-III components at the reforming NE and proper establishment of post-mitotic nucleo-cytoplasmic compartmentalisation. These data identify a novel membrane-binding activity within an ESCRT-III subunit that is essential for post-mitotic nuclear regeneration.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryCHMP7s atypical N-terminus is a membrane-binding module that allows assembly and function of ESCRT-III at the nuclear envelope during mitotic exit.\n",
      "ESCRT-III proteins have been implicated in sealing the nuclear envelope in mammals, spindle pole body dynamics in fission yeast, and surveillance of defective nuclear pore complexes in budding yeast. Here, we report that Lem2p (LEM2), a member of the LEM (Lap2-Emerin-Man1) family of inner nuclear membrane proteins, and the ESCRT-II/ESCRT-III hybrid protein Cmp7p (CHMP7), work together to recruit additional ESCRT-III proteins to holes in the nuclear membrane. In S. pombe, deletion of the ATPase vps4 leads to severe defects in nuclear morphology and integrity. These phenotypes are suppressed by loss-of-function mutations that arise spontaneously in lem2 or cmp7, implying that these proteins may function upstream in the same pathway. Building on these genetic interactions, we explored the role of LEM2 during nuclear envelope reformation in human cells. We found that CHMP7 and LEM2 enrich at the same region of the chromatin disc periphery during this window of cell division, and that CHMP7 can bind directly to the C-terminal domain of LEM2 in vitro. We further found that, during nuclear envelope formation, recruitment of the ESCRT factors CHMP7, CHMP2A and IST1/CHMP8 all depend on LEM2 in human cells. We conclude that Lem2p/LEM2 is a conserved nuclear site-specific adaptor that recruits Cmp7p/CHMP7 and downstream ESCRT factors to the nuclear envelope.\n",

      "Recently emerging methodology for generating human tissues in vitro has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery and disease research. Currently, three-dimensional cell culture models either rely on the pronounced ability of mammalian cells to self organize in vitro1-6, or use bioengineered constructs to arrange cells in an organ-like configuration7,8. While self-organizing organoids can recapitulate developmental events at a remarkable level of detail, bioengineered constructs excel at reproducibly generating tissue of a desired architecture. Here, we combine these two approaches to reproducibly generate micropatterned human forebrain tissue while maintaining its self-organizing capacity. We utilize poly(lactide-co-glycolide) copolymer (PLGA) fiber microfilaments as a scaffold to generate elongated embryoid bodies and demonstrate that this influences tissue identity. Micropatterned engineered cerebral organoids (enCORs) display enhanced neuroectoderm formation and improved cortical development. Furthermore, we reconstitute the basement membrane at later stages leading to characteristic cortical tissue architecture including formation of a polarized cortical plate and radial units. enCORs provide the first in vitro system for modelling the distinctive radial organization of the cerebral cortex and allow for the study of neuronal migration. We demonstrate their utility by modelling teratogenic effects of ethanol and show that defects in leading process formation may be responsible for the neuronal migration deficits in fetal alcohol syndrome. Our data demonstrate that combining 3D cell culture with bioengineering can significantly enhance tissue identity and architecture, and establish organoid models for teratogenic compounds.\n",
      "Bacterial lipoproteins are a class of extracellular proteins tethered to cell membranes by covalently attached lipids. Deleting the lipoprotein signal peptidase (lsp) gene in Streptomyces coelicolor results in growth and developmental defects that cannot be restored by reintroducing the lsp. We report resequencing of the genomes of the wild-type M145 and the cis-complemented {Delta}lsp mutant (BJT1004), mapping and identifying secondary mutations, including an insertion into a novel putative small RNA, scr6809. Disruption of scr6809 led to a range of developmental phenotypes. However, these secondary mutations do not increase the efficiency of disrupting lsp suggesting they are not lsp specific suppressors. Instead we suggest that these were induced by introducing the cosmid St4A10{Delta}lsp as part of the Redirect mutagenesis protocol, which transiently duplicates a number of important cell division genes. Disruption of lsp using no gene duplication resulted in the previously observed phenotype. We conclude that lsp is not essential in S. coelicolor but loss of lsp does lead to developmental defects due to the loss of lipoproteins from the cell. Significantly, our results indicate the use of cosmid libraries for the genetic manipulation of bacteria can lead to unexpected phenotypes not necessarily linked to the gene or pathway of interest.\n",
      "Axons are the cable-like neuronal processes wiring the nervous system. They contain parallel bundles of microtubules as structural backbones, surrounded by regularly-spaced actin rings termed the periodic membrane skeleton (PMS). Despite being an evolutionarily-conserved, ubiquitous, highly-ordered feature of axons, the function of PMS is unknown. Here we studied PMS abundance, organisation and function, combining versatile Drosophila genetics with super-resolution microscopy and various functional readouts. Analyses with 11 different actin regulators and 3 actin-targeting drugs suggest PMS to contain short actin filaments which are depolymerisation resistant and sensitive to spectrin, adducin and nucleator deficiency - consistent with microscopy-derived models proposing PMS as specialised cortical actin. Upon actin removal we observed gaps in microtubule bundles, reduced microtubule polymerisation and reduced axon numbers suggesting a role of PMS in microtubule organisation. These effects become strongly enhanced when carried out in neurons lacking the microtubule-stabilising protein Short stop (Shot). Combining the aforementioned actin manipulations with Shot deficiency revealed a close correlation between PMS abundance and microtubule regulation, consistent with a model in which PMS-dependent microtubule polymerisation contributes to their maintenance in axons. We discuss potential implications of this novel PMS function along axon shafts for axon maintenance and regeneration.\\n\\nSignificance statementAxons are cable-like neuronal processes that are up to a meter long in humans. These delicate structures often need to be maintained for an organisms lifetime, i.e. up to a century in humans. Unsurprisingly, we gradually lose about 50% of axons as we age. Bundles of microtubules form the structural backbones and highways for life-sustaining transport within axons, and maintenance of these bundles is essential for axonal longevity. However, the mechanisms which actively maintain axonal microtubules are poorly understood. Here we identify cortical actin as an important factor maintaining microtubule polymerisation in axons. This finding provides potential explanations for the previously identified, but unexplained, links between mutations in genes encoding cortical actin regulators and neurodegeneration.\n",

      "CD44 transmembrane glycoprotein is involved in angiogenesis, but it is not clear whether CD44 functions as a pro- or antiangiogenic molecule. Here, we assess the role of CD44 in angiogenesis and endothelial proliferation by using Cd44-null mice and CD44 silencing in human endothelial cells. We demonstrate that angiogenesis is increased in Cd44-null mice compared to either wild-type or heterozygous animals. Silencing of CD44 expression in cultured endothelial cells results in their augmented proliferation and viability. The growth-suppressive effect of CD44 is mediated by its extracellular domain and is independent of its hyaluronan binding function. CD44-mediated effect on cell proliferation is independent of specific angiogenic growth factor stimulation. These results show that CD44 expression on endothelial cells constrains endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Thus, endothelial CD44 might serve as a therapeutic target both in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, where endothelial protection is desired, as well as in cancer treatment, due to its antiangiogenic properties.\n",

MSC were isolated, purified and expanded in vitro from umbilical cord (UC) and umbilical cord blood (UCB), white adipose tissue (WAT), bone marrow (BM), and amniotic membrane of placenta (AMN).\\n\\nECFC were isolated from UC and UCB, WAT and peripheral blood (PB). ECFC and MSC and were co-transplanted admixed with extracellular matrix (Matrigel(R)) at a ratio of 5:1 to immune-deficient NSG mice, subcutaneously. The transplants were harvested after two weeks and the state of vessel formation and stability in the explants were investigated using immune-histochemical methods. The number of created micro-vessels was quantified using Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) staining followed by image J quantification.\\n\\nResults showed that ECFC and MSC possess variable capacity in contributing to neo-vasculogenesis. WAT and UCB-derived ECFC and WAT, UCB and BM-derived MSC are most potent cells in terms of neo-vessel formation in vivo. UC-derived ECFC and AMN-derived MSC have been shown to be least potent in contributing to neo-vasculogenesis. This variability might be due to variable phenotypes, or different genetic profiles of MSC and ECFC isolated from different tissues and/or donors.\\n\\nThe findings might give an insight into better regenerative strategies for neo-vessel formation in vivo.\n",
      "The human DARC (Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines) gene encodes a membrane-bound chemokine receptor crucial for the infection of red blood cells by Plasmodium vivax, a major causative agent of malaria. Of the three major allelic classes segregating in human populations, the FY*O allele has been shown to protect against P. vivax infection and is near fixation in sub-Saharan Africa, while FY*B and FY*A are common in Europe and Asia, respectively. Due to the combination of its strong geographic differentiation and association with malaria resistance, DARC is considered a canonical example of a locus under positive selection in humans.\\n\\nHere, we use sequencing data from over 1,000 individuals in twenty-one human populations, as well as ancient human and great ape genomes, to analyze the fine scale population structure of DARC. We estimate the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the FY*O mutation to be 42 kya (95% CI: 34-49 kya). We infer the FY*O null mutation swept to fixation in Africa from standing variation with very low initial frequency (0.1%) and a selection coefficient of 0.043 (95% CI:0.011-0.18), which is among the strongest estimated in the genome. We estimate the TMRCA of the FY*A mutation to be 57 kya (95% CI: 48-65 kya) and infer that, prior to the sweep of FY*O, all three alleles were segregating in Africa, as highly diverged populations from Asia and =Khomani San hunter-gatherers share the same FY*A haplotypes. We test multiple models of admixture that may account for this observation and reject recent Asian or European admixture as the cause.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryInfectious diseases have undoubtedly played an important role in ancient and modern human history. Yet, there are relatively few regions of the genome involved in resistance to pathogens that have shown a strong selection signal. We revisit the evolutionary history of a gene associated with resistance to the most common malaria-causing parasite, Plasmodium vivax, and show that it is one of regions of the human genome that has been under strongest selective pressure in our evolutionary history (selection coefficient: 5%). Our results are consistent with a complex evolutionary history of the locus involving selection on a mutation that was at a very low frequency in the ancestral African population (standing variation) and a large differentiation between European, Asian and African populations.\n",
      "A critical step in cellular trafficking pathways is the budding of membranes by protein coats, which recent experiments have demonstrated can be inhibited by elevated membrane tension. The robustness of processes like clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) across a diverse range of organisms and mechanical environments suggests that the protein machinery in this process has evolved to take advantage of some set of physical design principles to ensure robust vesiculation against opposing forces like membrane tension. Using a theoretical model for membrane mechanics and membrane protein interaction, we have systematically investigated the influence of membrane rigidity, curvature induced by the protein coat, area covered by the protein coat, membrane tension and force from actin polymerization on bud formation. Under low tension, the membrane smoothly evolves from a flat to budded morphology as the coat area or spontaneous curvature increases, whereas the membrane remains essentially flat at high tensions. At intermediate, physiologically relevant, tensions, the membrane undergoes a snapthrough instability in which small changes in the coat area, spontaneous curvature or membrane tension cause the membrane to \\\"snap\\\" from an open, U-shape to a closed bud. This instability can be smoothed out by increasing the bending rigidity of the coat, allowing for successful budding at higher membrane tensions. Additionally, applied force from actin polymerization can bypass the instability by inducing a smooth transition from an open to a closed bud. Finally, a combination of increased coat rigidity and force from actin polymerization enables robust vesiculation even at high membrane tensions.\\n\\nSignificance statementPlasma membrane tension plays an important role in various biological processes.

      "We consider life as a cyclic physicochemical process that makes heredity and Darwinian evolution observable through living cells. We elaborate four principles that constrain current speculations about lifes emergence to natural processes driven by diurnal physicochemical gradients, primarily of temperature, water activity and electromagnetic radiation. First, Earths prebiotic chemical evolution is historically continuous with Darwinian evolution; second, cycling energies of solar radiation are primary drivers of chemical evolution; third, environmental molecular complexity must be high at the origin of life; and fourth, non-covalent molecular forces determine molecular recognition and cellular organization. Under normal physiological conditions of high ionic strength and high macromolecular crowding, hydration interactions (hydrogen bonding), screened electrostatic forces and excluded volume repulsions act over a commensurate distance of about one nanometer. This intermolecular distance governs chemical coevolution of proto-biomacromolecular surfaces (nucleic acids, proteins and membranes) toward Darwinian thresholds and living states. The above physicochemical principles of lifes emergence are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics, and with the current facts of molecular microbiology and planetary sciences. New kinds of experimentation with crowded molecular mixtures under oscillating temperature gradients - a PCR-like mechanism of lifes origins - can further illuminate how living states come about.\\n\\nGraphical abstractLifes emergence follows from chemical and Darwinian evolution, a high degree of molecular complexity and a high crowdedness, and non-covalent molecular forces that determine molecular recognition and cellular organization. The macromolecules divide the cytoplasm into dynamically crowded macromolecular regions and topologically complementary electrolyte pools. Small ions and ionic metabolites are transported vectorially between the electrolyte pools and through the (semi-conducting) electrolyte pathways of the crowded macromolecular regions.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=103 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/050740_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (36K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1963682org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d49be0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@45ac46org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@312efc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG\n",
      "Ion channels are ubiquitous in living systems. Through interactions with membrane potential, ion channels both control metabolic events and mediate cell communication. Consequentially, membrane bioelectricity bears on fields ranging from cancer etiology to computational neuro-science. Conductance models have proven successful in quantitatively capturing these dynamics but are often considered difficult, with interpretation relegated to specialists. To facilitate research in membrane dynamics, especially in fields where roles for ion channels are just beginning to be quantified, we must make these models easy to understand.\\n\\nHere, we show that the membrane differential equation central to conductance models can be understood using simple circular geometry. The membrane state diagrams we construct are compact, faithful representations of conductance model state, designed to look like circular \\\"cells\\\" with currents flowing in and out. Every feature of a membrane state diagram corresponds to a physiological variable, so that insight taken from a diagram can be translated back to the underlying model. The construction is elementary: we convert conductances to angles subtended on the circle and potentials to radii; currents are then areas of the enclosed annular sectors.\\n\\nOur method clarifies a powerful but prohibitive modeling approach and has the potential for widespread use in both electrophysiological research and pedagogy. We illustrate how membrane state diagrams can augment traditional methods in the stability analysis of voltage equilibria and in depicting the Hodgkin-Huxley action potential, and we use the diagrams to infer the possibility of nontrivial fixed-voltage channel population dynamics by visual inspection rather than linear algebra.\n",
      "Most sense organs of arthropods are ensconced in small exoskeletal compartments that hinder direct access to plasma membranes. We have developed a method for exposing live sensory and supporting cells in such structures. The technique uses a viscous light cured resin to embed and support the structure, which is then sliced with a sharp blade. We term the procedure a  goggatomy, from the Khoisan word for a bug, gogga. To demonstrate the utility of the method we show that it can be used to expose the auditory chordotonal organs in the second antennal segment and the olfactory receptor neurons in the third antennal segment of Drosophila melanogaster, preserving the transduction machinery. The procedure can also be used on other small arthropods, like mites, Daphnia, mosquitoes, wasps and ants to expose a variety of cells.\n",
      "The nuclear pore complex (NPC) selectively transports cargo between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The inner nuclear membrane (INM) face of the NPC also serves as a hub where gene silencing and DNA repair are spatially coordinated. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, partitioning of active and silenced chromatin at subtelomeric regions depends on the boundary activity of nonessential nucleoporin proteins Nup2 and Nup60, along with Htz1, the histone variant H2A.Z. The INM is also important for the chromosome events of meiosis since Ndj1-mediated telomere attachment and clustering at the INM is required for efficient homolog pairing, recombination, and segregation. Here we tested possible meiotic roles for Nup2, Nup60, Htz1, and other nonessential nucleoporins by analyzing the effects of deletion mutations on sporulation, spore viability and possible phenotypic epistasis with ndj1{Delta}. Deleting NUP2, NUP60, and HTZ1 reduced spore viability compared to wild-type (WT). A detailed analysis of spore lethality indicated that homolog nondisjunction in these mutants was elevated compared to WT, yet unlike ndj1{Delta}, this was not the predominant cause of spore death. Deleting NUP84 reduced meiosis I nuclear divisions, while deleting NUP53, NUP100, and NUP157 had no effect on sporulation, spore viability, or the kinetics of meiosis I progression. Surprisingly, nup2{Delta} ndj1{Delta} uniquely failed to undergo meiosis I nuclear divisions, suggesting Nup2 and Ndj1 function in partially redundant pathways or create a poisonous intermediate. The meiosis I division was also delayed by 2 hours in nup2{Delta} compared to WT pointing to a specialized role for Nup2 in the meiotic program.\n",
      "During nervous system development, neurons and their progenitors often migrate to their final destinations. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the bilateral Q neuroblasts and their descendants migrate long distances in opposite directions, despite being born in the same posterior region. QR on the right migrates anteriorly and generates the AQR neuron positioned near the head, and QL on the left migrates posteriorly, giving rise to the PQR neuron positioned near the tail. In a screen for genes required for AQR and PQR migration, we identified an allele of nfm-1, which encodes a molecule similar to vertebrate NF2/Merlin, an important tumor suppressor in humans. Mutations in NF2 lead to Neurofibromatosis Type II, characterized by benign tumors of glial tissues. These molecules contain Four-point-one Ezrin Radixin Moesin (FERM) domains characteristic of cytoskeletal-membrane linkers, and vertebrate NF2 is required for epidermal integrity. Vertebrate NF2 can also regulate several transcriptional pathways including the Hippo pathway. Here we demonstrate that in C. elegans, nfm-1 is required for complete migration of AQR and PQR, and that it likely acts outside of the Q cells themselves in a non-autonomous fashion. We also show a genetic interaction between nfm-1 and the C. elegans Slit homolog slt-1, which encodes a conserved secreted guidance cue. In vertebrates, NF2 can control Slit2 mRNA levels through the hippo pathway in axon pathfinding, suggesting a conserved interaction of NF2 and Slit2 in regulating migration.\n",
      "Complexes of the respiratory chain are formed in a complex process where nuclearly-and mitochondrially-encoded components are assembled and inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane. The coordination of this process is named mitonuclear balance and experimental manipulations of mitonuclear balance can increase longevity of laboratory species.\\n\\nHere, we investigated the pattern of positive selection in annual (i.e. short-lived)and non-annual (i.e. long-lived) African killifishes to identify a genomic substrate for evolution of annual life history (and reduced lifespan).\\n\\nWe identified genes under positive selection in all mitonuclear balance: mitochondrial (mt) DNA replication, transcription from mt promoters, processing and stabilization of mt RNAs, mt translation, assembly of respiratory chain complexes and electron transport chain. Signs of convergent evolution are observed in four out of five steps. This strongly indicates that these genes are preferential genetic targets for the evolution of short lifespan and annual life cycle\n",
      "It is vital that cells respond rapidly to mechanical cues within their microenvironment through changes in cell shape and volume, which rely upon the mechanical properties of cells highly interconnected cytoskeletal networks and intracellular fluid redistributions. While previous research has largely investigated deformation mechanics, we now focus on the immediate cell-shape recovery response following mechanical perturbation by inducing large, local, and reproducible cellular deformations using AFM. By continuous imaging within the plane of deformation, we characterize the membrane and cortical response of HeLa cells to unloading, and model the recovery via overdamped viscoelastic dynamics. Importantly, the majority (90%) of HeLa cells recover their cell shape in < 1s. Despite actin remodelling on this time scale, we show that cell recovery time is not affected by load duration nor magnitude. To further explore this rapid recovery response, we expose cells to cytoskeletal destabilizers and osmotic shock conditions, which exposes the interplay between actin and osmotic pressure. We show that the rapid dynamics of recovery depend crucially on intracellular pressure, and provide strong evidence that cortical actin is the key regulator in the cell-shape recovery processes, in both cancerous and non-cancerous epithelial cells.\n",

      "Autophagy is a cellular degradation process essential for neuronal development and survival. Neurons are highly polarized cells in which autophagosome biogenesis is spatially compartmentalized. The mechanisms and physiological importance of this spatial compartmentalization of autophagy in the neuronal development of living animals are not well understood. Here we determine that, in C. elegans neurons, autophagosomes form near synapses and are required for neurodevelopment. We first determined, through unbiased genetic screens and systematic genetic analyses, that autophagy is required cell-autonomously for presynaptic assembly and for axon outgrowth dynamics in specific neurons. We observe autophagosomes in the axon near synapses, and this localization depends on the synaptic vesicle kinesin, KIF1A/UNC-104. KIF1A/UNC-104 coordinates localized autophagosome formation by regulating the transport of the integral membrane autophagy protein, ATG-9. Our findings indicate that autophagy is spatially regulated in neurons through the transport of ATG-9 by KIF1A/UNC-104 to regulate neurodevelopment.\n",
      "Introns are found in 5 untranslated regions (5UTRs) for 35% of all human transcripts. These 5UTR introns are not randomly distributed: genes that encode secreted, membrane-bound and mitochondrial proteins are less likely to have them. Curiously, transcripts lacking 5UTR introns tend to harbor specific RNA sequence elements in their early coding regions. To model and understand the connection between coding-region sequence and 5UTR intron status, we developed a classifier that can predict 5UTR intron status with >80% accuracy using only sequence features in the early coding region. Thus, the classifier identifies transcripts with 5 proximal-intron-minus-like-coding regions (\\\"5IM\\\" transcripts). Unexpectedly, we found that the early coding sequence features defining 5IM transcripts are widespread, appearing in 21% of all human RefSeq transcripts. The 5IM class of transcripts is enriched for non-AUG start codons, more extensive secondary structure both preceding the start codon and near the 5 cap, greater dependence on eIF4E for translation, and association with ER-proximal ribosomes. 5IM transcripts are bound by the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) at non-canonical 5 proximal positions. Finally, N1-methyladenosines are specifically enriched in the early coding regions of 5IM transcripts. Taken together, our analyses point to the existence of a distinct 5IM class comprising [~]20% of human transcripts. This class is defined by depletion of 5 proximal introns, presence of specific RNA sequence features associated with low translation efficiency, N1-methyladenosines in the early coding region, and enrichment for non-canonical binding by the Exon Junction Complex.\n",

      "Diverse molecules induce general anesthesia with potency strongly correlated both with their hydrophobicity and their effects on certain ion channels. We recently observed that several n-alcohol anesthetics inhibit heterogeneity in plasma membrane derived vesicles by lowering the critical temperature (Tc) for phase separation. Here we exploit conditions that stabilize membrane heterogeneity to further test the correlation between the anesthetic potency of n-alcohols and effects on Tc. First we show that hexadecanol acts oppositely to n-alcohol anesthetics on membrane mixing and antagonizes ethanol induced anesthesia in a tadpole behavioral assay. Second, we show that two previously described  intoxication reversers raise Tc and counter ethanols effects in vesicles, mimicking the findings of previous electrophysiological and behavioral measurements. Third, we find that hydrostatic pressure, long known to reverse anesthesia, also raises Tc in vesicles with a magnitude that counters the effect of butanol at relevant concentrations and pressures. Taken together,these results demonstrate that {Delta}Tc predicts anesthetic potency for n-alcohols better than hydrophobicity in a range of contexts, supporting a mechanistic role for membrane heterogeneity in general anesthesia.\n",
      "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) regulate signal transduction and cellular behavior, yet studying PPIs within live cells remains fundamentally challenging. We have miniaturized the affinity pulldown, a gold-standard PPI interrogation technique, for use within live cells. Our assay hijacks endogenous myosin motors to forcibly traffic, or pulldown, macromolecular complexes within the native cytosolic environment. Macromolecules captured by nanoscale pulldown (NanoSPD) are optically interrogated in situ by tagging individual protein components. Critically, continuous motor trafficking concentrates query complexes into nanoscopic subcellular compartments, providing fluorescence enhancement and allowing nanoscale pulldowns to be visualized and quantified by standard microscopy. Nanoscale pulldown is compatible with nuclear, membrane-associated and cytoplasmic proteins and can investigate functional effects of protein truncations or amino acid substitutions. Moreover, binding hierarchies in larger complexes can be quickly examined within the natural cytosol, making nanoscale pulldown a powerful new optical platform for quantitative high-content screening of known and novel PPIs that act within macromolecular assemblies.\n",
      "HIV-1 full-length, unspliced genomic RNAs (gRNAs) serve both as mRNAs encoding the Gag and Gag-Pol capsid proteins as well as the genetic material packaged by Gag into virions that assemble at the plasma membrane (PM). Whether localized Gag synthesis contributes to assembly at the PM is unknown. Here we show that artificially tethering gRNAs or surrogate gag-pol mRNAs to non-PM membranes or the actin cytoskeleton can markedly affect Gags distribution in the cytoplasm, causing aberrant subcellular sites of assembly and severe reductions to virus particle output. Only gag-pol mRNAs competent for translation were capable of altering Gags distribution within the cell, and the activity mapped to two cis-acting RNA regulatory elements; the 5 packaging signal (Psi) bound by Gag and, unexpectedly, the Rev response element (RRE) that regulates the nuclear export of gRNAs and other intron-retaining viral RNAs. Taken together, our results suggest a model wherein localized translation of gRNAs at the PM helps to compartmentalize Gag-gRNA interactions, thereby promoting efficient genome encapsidation.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe spatial distribution of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) within the cytoplasm can be a crucial determinant of gene expression. Here we provide evidence that a devastating viral pathogen, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), exploits localized translation to favor the formation of infectious, transmissible virions at the surface of infected cells. Artificially tethering viral mRNAs encoding the Gag and Gag-Pol capsid proteins (gag-pol mRNAs) to alternative regions of the cell such as cytoplasmic vesicles or the actin cytoskeletion markedly alters Gag subcellular distribution, perturbs sites of assembly, and reduces virus particle production. These and additional findings suggest a model for HIV-1 assembly wherein localized Gag/Gag-Pol translation coupled to confined interactions between Gag and viral genomes ensures infectious virion production at the right place and the right time.

      "Cilia are conserved organelles that have important motility, sensory and signalling roles. The transition zone (TZ) at the base of the cilium is critical for cilia function, and defects in several TZ proteins are associated with human congenital ciliopathies such as Nephronophthisis (NPHP) and Meckel Gruber syndrome (MKS). In several species, MKS and NPHP proteins form separate complexes that cooperate with Cep290 to assemble the TZ, but flies lack an obvious NPHP complex. We show that MKS proteins in flies are spatially separated from Cep290 at the TZ, and that flies mutant for individual MKS genes fail to recruit other MKS proteins to the TZ, while Cep290 appears to be recruited normally. Although there are abnormalities in microtubule and membrane organisation in developing MKS mutant cilia, these defects are less apparent in adults, where sensory cilia and sperm flagella function quite normally. Thus, surprisingly, MKS proteins are not essential for cilia or flagella function in flies.\n",

      "Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) is an important tool used by cell biologists to study the diffusion and binding kinetics of vesicles, proteins, and other molecules in the cytoplasm, nucleus or cell membrane. While many FRAP models have been developed over the past decades, the influence of the complex boundaries of three-dimensional cellular geometries on the recovery curves, in conjunction with ROI and optical effects (imaging, photobleaching, photoswitching, and scanning), has not been well studied. Here, we developed a three-dimensional computational model of the FRAP process that incorporates particle diffusion, cell boundary effects, and the optical properties of the scanning confocal microscope, and validated this model using the tip-growing cells of Physcomitrella patens. We then show how these cell boundary and optical effects confound the interpretation of FRAP recovery curves, including the number of dynamic states of a given fluorescent protein, in a wide range of cellular geometries-both in two and three dimensions-namely nuclei, filopodia, and lamellipodia of mammalian cells, and in cell types such as the budding yeast, S. pombe, and tip-growing plant cells. We explored the performance of existing analytical and algorithmic FRAP models in these various cellular geometries, and determined that the VCell VirtualFRAP tool provides the best accuracy to measure diffusion coefficients. Our computational model is not limited only to these cells types, but can easily be extended to other cellular geometries via the graphical Java-based application we also provide. This particle-based simulation-called the Digital Confocal Microscopy Suite, DCMS-can also perform fluorescence dynamics assays, such as Number and Brightness (N&B), Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS), Raster Image Correlation Spectroscopy (RICS), and could help shape the way these techniques are interpreted.\n",

      "The sensory functions of cilia are dependent on the enrichment of ciliary resident proteins. While it is known that ciliary targeting signals (CTSs) specifically target ciliary proteins to cilia, it is still unclear how CTSs facilitate the entry and retention of ciliary residents at the molecular level. We found that non-ciliary membrane reporters can passively diffuse to cilia via the lateral transport pathway and the translocation of membrane reporters through the ciliary diffusion barrier is facilitated by importin binding motifs/domains. Screening known CTSs of ciliary membrane residents uncovered that fibrocystin, photoreceptor retinol dehydrogenase, rhodopsin and retinitis pigmentosa 2 interact with transportin1 (TNPO1) via previously identified CTSs. We further discovered that a novel ternary complex, comprising TNPO1, Rab8 and CTS, can assemble or disassemble under the guanine nucleotide exchange of Rab8. Our study suggests a novel mechanism in which TNPO1/Rab8/CTS complex mediates selective entry and retention of cargos within cilia.\n",
      "Fast excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian central nervous system is largely carried out by AMPA-sensitive ionotropic glutamate receptors. Localized within the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic spines, AMPA receptors are composed of heterotetrameric receptor assemblies associated with auxiliary subunits, the most common of which are transmembrane AMPA-receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs). The association of TARPs with AMPA receptors modulates the kinetics of receptor gating and pharmacology, as well as trafficking. Here we report the cryo-EM structure of the homomeric GluA2 AMPA receptor saturated with TARP {gamma}2 subunits, showing how the TARPs are arranged with four-fold symmetry around the ion channel domain, making extensive interactions with the M1, M2 and M4 TM helices. Poised like partially opened  hands underneath the two-fold symmetric ligand binding domain (LBD)  clamshells, one pair of TARPs are juxtaposed near the LBD dimer interface, while the other pair are near the LBD dimer-dimer interface. The extracellular  domains of TARP are positioned to not only modulate LBD  clamshell closure, but also to affect conformational rearrangements of the LBD layer associated with receptor activation and desensitization, while the TARP transmembrane (TM) domains buttress the ion channel pore.\n",

Most organisms thrive within a temperature range that rarely exceeds [~] 30{degrees}C, but the deep subsurface bacterium Kosmotoga olearia can grow over a temperature range of 59{degrees}C (20{degrees}C -79{degrees}C). To identify genes correlated with this flexible phenotype, we compared transcriptomes of K. olearia cultures grown at its optimal 65{degrees}C to those at 30{degrees}C, 40{degrees}C, and 77{degrees}C. The temperature treatments affected expression of 573 of 2,224 K. olearia genes. Notably, this transcriptional response elicits re-modeling of the cellular membrane and changes in metabolism, with increased expression of genes involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism at high temperatures and up-regulation of amino acid metabolism at lower temperatures. At sub-optimal temperatures, many transcriptional changes were similar to those observed in mesophilic bacteria at physiologically low temperatures, including up-regulation of typical cold stress genes and ribosomal proteins. Comparative genomic analysis of additional Thermotogae genomes, indicate that one of K. olearia's strategies for low temperature growth is increased copy number of some typical cold response genes through duplication and/or lateral acquisition.

      "Fluorescent lipophilic dyes, such as DiI, stain cellular membranes and are used extensively for retrograde/anterograde labelling of neurons as well as for marking the position of extracellular electrodes after electrophysiology. Convenient histological clearing techniques, such as CLARITY, enable immunostaining and imaging of large volumes for 3D-reconstruction. However, such clearing works by removing lipids and, as an unintended consequence, also removes lipophilic dyes. To remedy this wash-out, the molecular structure of the dye can be altered to adhere to both membranes and proteins so the dye remains in the tissue after lipid-clearing. Nevertheless, the capacity of such modified dyes to remain in tissue has not yet been tested. Here, we test dyes with molecular modifications that make them aldehyde-fixable to proteins. We use three Dil-analogue dyes, CM-DiI, SP-DiI and FM 1-43FX that are modified to be CLARITY-compatible candidates. We use the challenging adult, myelin-rich spinal cord tissue, which requires prolonged lipid-clearing, of rats and mice. All three dyes remained in the tissue after lipid-clearing, but CM-DiI had the sharpest and FM 1-43FX the strongest fluorescent signal.\n",
      "BackgroundTo study cathepsin K location in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC), its traffic and expression levels in cultured oral cell lines; and to analyze the effect of interleukin (IL)-1 on OTSCC invasion.\\n\\nMethodsCathepsin K expression in OTSCC tissue samples was analyzed with immunostaining; its intracellular traffic was followed in HSC-3 cells after PMA treatment. HSC-3 and two oral keratinocyte cell lines, oral carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and primary gingival fibroblasts (GF) were treated with IL-1. Cathepsin K expression was measured using PCR and ELISA. Lastly, the effects of IL-1 on HSC-3 invasiveness, alone and in co-cultures with fibroblasts in the 3D myoma invasion model, were determined.\\n\\nResultsCathepsin K in OTSCC cells was found in vesicles close to cell membrane and within exosomes. While cathepsin K was expressed at the basal level in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts, basal IL-1 levels were higher in epithelial cells compared with GFs and CAFs. Cathepsin K expression was slightly induced by IL-1 in all cell lines, but it did not affect HSC-3 invasiveness.\\n\\nConclusionIn OTSCC, cathepsin K remains mostly intracellular and it is slightly secreted within exosomes. IL-1 treatment has no effect on HSC-3 invasiveness in 3D myoma model.\n",
      "The organization of chromatin is a regulator of molecular processes including transcription, replication, and DNA repair. The structures within chromatin that regulate these processes span from the nucleosomal (10nm) to the chromosomal (>200nm) levels, with little known about the dynamics of chromatin structure between these scales due to a lack of quantitative imaging technique in live cells. Previous work using Partial Wave Spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy, a quantitative imaging technique with sensitivity to macromolecular organization between 20-200nm, has shown that transformation of chromatin at these length scales is a fundamental event during carcinogenesis. As the dynamics of chromatin likely play a critical regulatory role in cellular function, it is critical to develop live-cell imaging techniques that can probe the real-time temporal behavior of the chromatin nano-architecture. Therefore, we developed a live cell PWS technique which allows high-throughput, label-free study of the causal relationship between nanoscale organization and molecular function in real-time. In this work, we employ live cell PWS to study the change in chromatin structure due to DNA damage and expand on the link between metabolic function and the structure of higher-order chromatin. In particular, we studied the temporal changes to chromatin during UV light exposure, show that live cell DNA binding dyes induce damage to chromatin within seconds, and demonstrate a direct link between higher-order chromatin structure and mitochondrial membrane potential. Since biological function is tightly paired with structure, live cell PWS is a powerful tool to study the nanoscale structure-function relationship in live cells.\\n\\nSignificance StatementChromatin is one of the most critical structures within the cell because it houses most genetic information. Its structure is well understood at the nucleosomal (<20nm) and chromosomal (>200nm) levels, however, due to the lack of quantitative imaging modalities to study this organization, little is known about the higher-order structure between these length scales in live cells. We present a label-free technique, live cell Partial Wave Spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy with sensitivity to structures between 20-200nm that can quantify the nano-architecture in live cells. With this technique, we can detect DNA fragmentation and expand on the link between metabolic function and higher-order chromatin structure. Live cell PWS allows high-throughput, label-free study of the causal relationship between nanoscale organization and molecular function in live cells.\n",
      "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the major route of receptor internalization at the plasma membrane. Analysis of constitutive CME is complicated by the fact that initiation of endocytic events is unpredictable.

Here we describe a series of genetically encoded reporters that allow the initiation of CME on demand. This is achieved by inducibly tethering a clathrin \\\"hook\\\" to a plasma membrane \\\"anchor\\\". Our design incorporates temporal and spatial control of initiation using chemical and optical tools, and the cargo is defined. Since this system bypasses multiple steps in vesicle creation, we term it \\\"hot-wiring\\\". In this paper, we use hot-wired endocytosis to define the functional interactions between clathrin and the {beta}2 subunit of the AP2 complex.

      "This review describes the analytical calculation of lateral pressure profile in the hydrophobic part of the lipid bilayer with finite curvature based on previously developed microscopic model for lipid hydrocarbon chains. According to this theory the energy per unit chain is represented as energy of flexible string (Eulers elastic beam of finite thickness) and interaction between chains is considered as an entropic repulsion. This microscopic theory allows to obtain expression for lateral pressure distribution in bent bilayer if treating a bending as a small deviation from the flat membrane conformation and using perturbation theory. Because lateral pressure distribution is related to elastic properties of lipid bilayer then the first moment of lateral pressure and the expression for bending modulus may be derived from this theoretical model. Finally one can estimate the energy difference between two various conformational states of mechanosensitive channel embedded into the bilayer with pressure profile [Pcy]t(z).\n",
      "Biofuel alcohols have severe consequences on the microbial hosts used in their biosynthesis, which limits the productivity of the bioconversion. The cell envelope is one of the most strongly affected structures, in particular, as the external concentration of biofuels rises during biosynthesis. Damage to the cell envelope can have severe consequences, such as impairment of transport into and out of the cell; however the nature of butanol-induced envelope damage has not been well characterized. In the present study, the effects of n-butanol on the cell envelope of Escherichia coli were investigated. Using enzyme and fluorescence-based assays, we observed that 1% v/v n-butanol resulted in release of lipopolysaccharides from the outer membrane of E. coli and caused  leakiness in both outer and inner membranes. Higher concentrations of n-butanol, within the range of 2% - 10% (v/v), resulted in inner membrane protrusion through the peptidoglycan observed by characteristic blebs. The findings suggest that strategies for rational engineering of butanol-tolerant bacterial strains should take into account all components of the cell envelope.\n",

We conducted experimental evolution by daily diluting cultures in increasing concentrations of benzoic acid (up to 20 mM) buffered at external pH 6.5, a pH at which permeant acids concentrate in the cytoplasm. By 2,000 generations, clones isolated from evolving populations showed increasing tolerance to benzoate but were sensitive to chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Sixteen clones grew to stationary phase in 20 mM benzoate, whereas the ancestral strain W3110 peaked and declined. Similar growth occurred in 10 mM salicylate. Benzoate-evolved strains grew like W3110 in the absence of benzoate; in media buffered at pH 4.8, pH 7.0, or pH 9.0; or in 20 mM acetate or sorbate at pH 6.5. Genomes of 16 strains revealed over 100 mutations including SNPs, large deletions, and insertion knockouts. Most strains acquired deletions in the benzoate-induced multiple antibiotic resistance (Mar) regulon or in associated regulators such as rob and cpxA, as well as MDR efflux pumps emrA, emrY, and mdtA. Strains also lost or down-regulated the Gad acid fitness regulon. In 5 mM benzoate, or in 2 mM salicylate (2-hydroxybenzoate), most strains showed increased sensitivity to the antibiotics chloramphenicol and tetracycline; some strains were more sensitive than a marA knockout. Thus, our benzoate-evolved strains may reveal additional unknown drug resistance components. Benzoate or salicylate selection pressure may cause general loss of MDR genes and regulators.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEBenzoate is a common food preservative, and salicylate is the primary active metabolite of aspirin.

      "In eukaryotic cells, membranous vesicles and organelles are transported by ensembles of motor proteins. These motors, such as kinesin-1, have been well characterized in vitro as single molecules or as ensembles rigidly attached to non-biological substrates. However, the collective transport by membrane-anchored motors, i.e. motors attached to a fluid lipid bilayer, is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the influence of motors anchorage to a lipid bilayer on the collective transport characteristics. We reconstituted  membrane-anchored gliding motility assays using truncated kinesin-1 motors with a streptavidin-binding-peptide tag that can attach to streptavidin-loaded, supported lipid bilayers. We found that the diffusing kinesin-1 motors propelled the microtubules in presence of ATP. Notably, we found the gliding velocity of the microtubules to be strongly dependent on the number of motors and their diffusivity in the lipid bilayer. The microtubule gliding velocity increased with increasing motor density and membrane viscosity, reaching up to the stepping velocity of single-motors. This finding is in contrast to conventional gliding motility assays where the density of surface-immobilized kinesin-1 motors does not influence the microtubule velocity over a wide range. We reason, that the transport efficiency of membrane-anchored motors is reduced because of their slippage in the lipid bilayer, an effect which we directly observed using singlemolecule fluorescence microscopy. Our results illustrate the importance of the motor-cargo coupling, which potentially provides cells with an additional means of regulating the efficiency of cargo transport.\n",

      "The ClC family of transmembrane proteins functions throughout nature to control the transport of Cl- ions across biological membranes. ClC-ec1 from Escherichia coli is an antiporter, coupling the transport of Cl- and H+ ions in opposite directions and driven by the concentration gradients of the ions. Despite keen interest in this protein, the molecular mechanism of the Cl-/H+ coupling has not been fully elucidated. Here, we have used multiscale simulation to help identify the essential mechanism of the Cl-/H+ coupling. We find that the highest barrier for proton transport (PT) from the intra- to extracellular solution is attributable to a chemical reaction--the deprotonation of glutamic acid 148 (E148). This barrier is significantly reduced by the binding of Cl- in the \\\"central\\\" site (Cl-cen), which displaces E148 and thereby facilitates its deprotonation. Conversely, in the absence of Cl-cen E148 favors the \\\"down\\\" conformation, which results in a much higher cumulative rotation and deprotonation barrier that effectively blocks PT to the extracellular solution. Thus, the rotation of E148 plays a critical role in defining the Cl-/H+ coupling. As a control, we have also simulated PT in the ClC-ec1 E148A mutant to further understand the role of this residue. Replacement with a non-protonatable residue greatly increases the free energy barrier for PT from E203 to the extracellular solution, explaining the experimental result that PT in E148A is blocked whether or not Cl-cen is present. The results presented here suggest both how a chemical reaction can control the rate of PT and also how it can provide a mechanism for a coupling of the two ion transport processes.\n",
      "Fluorescence microscopy reveals that the contents of many (membrane-free) nuclear \\\"bodies\\\" exchange rapidly with the soluble pool whilst the underlying structure persists; such observations await a satisfactory biophysical explanation. To shed light on this, we perform large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of a chromatin fiber interacting with an ensemble of (multivalent) DNA-binding proteins; these proteins switch between two states - active (binding) and inactive (non-binding). This system provides a model for any DNA-binding protein that can be modified post-translationally to change its affinity for DNA (e.g., like the phosphorylation of a transcription factor). Due to this out-of-equilibrium process, proteins spontaneously assemble into clusters of self-limiting size, as individual proteins in a cluster exchange with the soluble pool with kinetics like those seen in photo-bleaching experiments. This behavior contrasts sharply with that exhibited by \\\"equilibrium\\\", or non-switching, proteins that exist only in the binding state; when these bind to DNA non-specifically, they form clusters that grow indefinitely in size. Our results point to post-translational modification of chromatin-bridging proteins as a generic mechanism driving the self-assembly of highly dynamic, non-equilibrium, protein clusters with the properties of nuclear bodies. Such active modification also reshapes intra-chromatin contacts to give networks resembling those seen in topologically-associating domains, as switching markedly favors local (short-range) contacts over distant ones.\n",

In order to explore their functional interaction, we engineered previously stable single-polypeptide-chain (sc) A2AR/D2LR: whether the molecular entity of the striatal A2AR/D2R antagonism, i.e., scA2AR/D2Rs are just A2AR/D2R with the antagonism, remains unresolved.\\n\\nNew MethodTo further clarify the heteromerization through the scA2AR/D2LR, we here designed supramolecularly  exclusive monomers and dimers, using the C{varepsilon}2 domain of IgE-Fc or apoproteins of the bacterial light-harvesting antenna complex.\\n\\nResultsA concept of the recptor protein assembly regulation, i.e., the selective monomer/non-obligate dimer formation was obtained. Although none of these new fusions were constructed or tested, we could aim at obtaining heterodimer-specific agents, using the scA2AR/D2R. Whether the resulting designs were explained feasibly and rationally was addressed. The structure and function of the non-obligate dimer were here discussed through scA2AR/D2R, focusing on the procedure of the membrane protein design and methods for transient protein-protein interactions.\\n\\nSummary and OutlookGiven that upon being expressed and allosteric regulation occurs regardless of specific signal to non-specific noise (S/N) ratio, the supramolecular designs, allowing us to express selectively monomer/non-obligate dimer of class A GPCR, are experimentally testable and will be used to confirm in vivo that such low S/N ratio interaction between A2AR and D2LR functions in the dopamine neurotransmission in the striatum.\\n\\nAbbreviations\n",

We investigated the role of ErbB receptors in valvulogenesis in vivo using ErbB1- and ErbB4-deficient mice, and an ex vivo model of endocardial cushion explants. We show that HB-EGF suppresses valve mesenchymal cell proliferation through a heterodimer of ErbB1 and ErbB4, and an ErbB1 ligand(s) promotes cell proliferation through a homodimer of ErbB1. Moreover, a rescue experiment with cleavable or uncleavable isoforms of ErbB4 in ERBB4 null cells suggests that the cytoplasmic intracellular domain of ErbB4, rather than the membrane-anchored tyrosine kinase, achieves this suppression. Our study demonstrates that opposing signals generated by different ErbB dimer combinations function in the same cardiac cushion mesenchymal cells for proper cardiac valve formation.\\n\\nSummary statementIn valvulogenesis, opposing signals generated by different combinations of ErbB-dimers elaborately regulate cell proliferation, in which proteolytically released intracellular domain of ErbB4 activated by HB-EGF is required to suppress proliferation.\n",
      "Water molecules inside G-protein coupled receptor have recently been spotlighted in a series of crystal structures. To decipher the dynamics and functional roles of internal waters in GPCR activity, we studied A2A adenosine receptor using sec-molecular dynamics simulations. Our study finds that the amount of water flux across the transmembrane (TM) domain varies depending on the receptor state, and that the water molecules of the TM channel in the active state flow three times slower than those in the inactive state. Depending on the location in solvent-protein interface as well as the receptor state, the average residence time of water in each residue varies from [Formula] psec to [Formula] nsec. Especially, water molecules, exhibiting ultraslow relaxation ([Formula] nsec) in the active state, are found around the microswitch residues that are considered activity hotspots for GPCR function. A continuous allosteric network spanning the TM domain, arising from water-mediated contacts, is unique in the active state, underscoring the importance of slow waters in the GPCR activation.\n",
      "Rho guanine exchange factors (RhoGEFs) control many aspects of the cellular cytoskeleton, and thereby regulate and control processes such as cell migration, cell adhesion and proliferation. TGAT is a splice variant of the RhoGEF Trio, with oncogenic potential. Whether the subcellular location of TGAT is critical for its activity is unknown. Confocal microscopy of fluorescent protein tagged TGAT revealed co-localization with a Golgi marker. Because plasma membrane localized RhoGEFs are particularly effective at activating RhoA, plasma membrane localization of TGAT was studied. In order to quantitatively measure plasma membrane association we developed a novel, highly sensitive image analysis method. The method requires a cytoplasmic marker and a plasma membrane marker, which are co-imaged with the tagged protein of interest. Linear unmixing is performed to determine the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic component in the fluorescence signal of protein of interest. The analysis revealed that wild-type TGAT is partially co-localized with the plasma membrane. Strikingly, cysteine TGAT-mutants lacking one or more palmitoylation sites in the C-tail, still showed membrane association. In contrast, a truncated variant, lacking the last 15 amino acids, TGAT{Delta}15, lost membrane association. The functional role of membrane localization was determined by measuring TGAT activity in single cells with a RhoA FRET-sensor and F-actin levels. Mutants of TGAT that still maintained membrane association showed similar activity as wild-type TGAT. In contrast, the activity was abrogated for the cytoplasmic TGAT{Delta}15 variant. Synthetic recruitment of TGAT{Delta}15 to membranes confirmed that TGAT effectively activates RhoA at the plasma membrane. Together, these results show that membrane association of TGAT is critical for its activity, but that palmitoylation is dispensable.\n",

      "For the last 500 years, the Americas have been a melting pot both for genetically diverse humans and for the pathogenic and commensal organisms associated with them. One such organism is the stomach dwelling bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which is highly prevalent in Latin America where it is a major current public health challenge because of its strong association with gastric cancer. By analyzing the genome sequence of H. pylori isolated in North, Central and South America, we found evidence for admixture between H. pylori of European and African origin throughout the Americas, without substantial input from pre-Columbian (hspAmerind) bacteria. In the US, strains of African and European origin have remained genetically distinct, while in Colombia and Nicaragua, bottlenecks and rampant genetic exchange amongst isolates have led to the formation of national gene pools. We found four outer membrane proteins with atypical levels of Asian ancestry in American strains, including the adhesion factor AlpB, suggesting a role for the ethnic makeup of hosts in the colonization of incoming strains. Our results show that new H. pylori subpopulations can rapidly arise, spread and adapt during times of demographic flux, and suggest that differences in transmission ecology between high and low prevalence areas may substantially affect the composition of bacterial populations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHelicobacter pylori is one of the best studied examples of an intimate association between bacteria and humans, due to its ability to colonize the stomach for decades and to transmit from generation to generation. A number of studies have sought to link diversity in H. pylori to human migrations but there are some discordant signals such as an \\\"out of Africa\\\" dispersal within the last few thousand years that has left a much stronger signal in bacterial genomes than in human ones. In order to understand how such discrepancies arise, we have investigated the evolution of H. pylori during the recent colonization of the Americas. We find that bacterial populations evolve quickly and can spread rapidly to people of different ethnicities. Distinct new bacterial subpopulations have formed in Colombia from a European source and in Nicaragua and the US from African sources. Genetic exchange between bacterial populations is rampant within Central and South America but is uncommon within North America, which may reflect differences in prevalence. Our results also suggest that adaptation of bacteria to particular human ethnic groups may be confined to a handful of genes involved in interaction with the immune system.\n",
      "Gain modulation is a computational mechanism critical for sensory processing. Yet, the cellular mechanisms that decrease the gain of cortical neurons are unclear. To test if low frequency subthreshold oscillations could reduce neuronal gain during wakefulness, we measured the membrane potential of primary visual cortex (V1) layer 2/3 excitatory, parvalbumin-positive (PV+), and somatostatin-positive (SOM+) neurons in awake mice during passive visual stimulation and sensory discrimination tasks. We found prominent 3-5 Hz membrane potential oscillations that reduced the gain of excitatory neurons but not the gain of PV+ and SOM+ interneurons, which oscillated synchronously with excitatory neurons and fired strongly at the peak of de polarizations. 3-5 Hz oscillation prevalence and timing were strongly modulated by visual input and the animals behavior al response, suggesting that these oscillations are triggered to adjust sensory responses for specific behavioral contexts. Therefore, these findings reveal a novel gain reduction mechanism that adapts sensory processing to behavior.\n",

      "Energization of thylakoid membranes brings about the acidification of the lumenal aqueous phase, which activates important regulatory mechanisms. Earlier Jajoo and coworkers (2014 FEBS Lett. 588:970) have shown that low pH in isolated plant thylakoid membranes induces changes in the excitation energy distribution between the two photosystems. In order to elucidate the structural background of these changes, we used small-angle neutron scattering on thylakoid membranes exposed to low p2H and show that gradually lowering the p2H from 8.0 to 5.0 causes small but well discernible reversible diminishment of the periodic order and the lamellar repeat distance and an increased mosaicity - similar to the effects elicited by light-induced acidification of the lumen. Our data strongly suggest that thylakoids dynamically respond to the membrane energization and actively participate in different regulatory mechanisms.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThylakoid membranes exposed to low p2H studied by small-angle neutron scattering\\nC_LIO_LIAcidification causes reversible shrinkage and diminished lamellar order\\nC_LIO_LISANS changes induced by low pH resemble those due to light-induced lumenal acidification\\nC_LI\\n\\nAbbreviations\n",
      "Chromosomal segregation and cytokinesis are tightly regulated processes required for successful cell division. The cysteine protease separase cleaves a subunit of the cohesin complex to allow chromosome segregation at anaphase onset. Separase also regulates meiotic cortical granule exocytosis and vesicle trafficking during cytokinesis, both of which involve RAB-11. Separase has non-proteolytic signaling functions in addition to its role in substrate cleavage, and its mechanism in exocytosis is unknown. We sought to determine whether separase regulates RAB-11 vesicle exocytosis through a proteolytic or non-proteolytic mechanism. To address this question, we generated a protease-dead separase, SEP-1PD::GFP, and unexpectedly found that it is dominant negative. Consistent with its role in cohesin cleavage, SEP-1PD::GFP causes chromosome segregation defects. Depletion of the substrate subunit of cohesin rescues this defect, suggesting that SEP-1PD::GFP impairs cohesin cleavage by a substrate trapping mechanism. We investigated whether SEP-1PD::GFP also impairs RAB-11 vesicle trafficking. SEP-1PD::GFP causes a low rate of cytokinesis failure that is synergistically exacerbated by depletion of the core exocytic t-SNARE protein SYX-4. Interestingly, SEP-1PD::GFP causes an accumulation of RAB-11 vesicles at the cleavage furrow site and delayed the exocytosis of cortical granules during anaphase I. Depletion of syx-4 further enhanced RAB-11::mCherry and SEP-1PD::GFP plasma membrane accumulation during cytokinesis. These findings suggest that the protease activity of separase is required for the exocytosis of RAB-11 vesicles during cortical granule exocytosis and mitotic cytokinesis.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe defining event of cell division is the equal distribution of the genetic material to daughter cells. Once sister chromatids align on the metaphase plate, the cell releases the brakes to enter anaphase by activating the protease separase. Separase cleaves the cohesin glue holding duplicated sister chromatids together allowing chromosome segregation. Subsequently, the cell must orchestrate a complex series of anaphase events to equally partition the chromatids and the rest of the cellular components into two distinct daughter cells during cytokinesis. Separase has multiple functions during anaphase to help regulate several key events, including promoting vesicle exocytosis required for cytokinesis. Previous studies have shown that separase can exert control over different events either through substrate cleavage, or by triggering signaling pathways. Here we analyze the cellular functions of separase that are impacted by protease inactive separase. Our results show that separase cleaves cohesin to promote chromosome segregation and also cleaves another independent substrate to promote exocytosis. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the molecular control of separase in exocytosis and indicate that separase has multiple independent substrates that it must cleave to execute various functions. This mechanism may enable the cell to coordinate multiple anaphase events with chromosome segregation.\n",
      "The response of lipid bilayers to osmotic stress is an important part of cellular function. Previously, in (Oglecka et al., 2014), we reported that cell-sized giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) exposed to hypotonic media, respond to the osmotic assault by undergoing a cyclical sequence of swelling and bursting events, coupled to the membranes compositional degrees of freedom. Here, we seek to deepen our quantitative understanding of the essential pulsatile behavior of GUVs under hypotonic conditions, by advancing a comprehensive theoretical model for vesicle dynamics. The model quantitatively captures our experimentally measured swell-burst parameters for single-component GUVs, and reveals that thermal fluctuations enable rate dependent pore nucleation, driving the dynamics of the swell-burst cycles. We further identify new scaling relationships between the pulsatile dynamics and GUV properties. Our findings provide a fundamental framework that has the potential to guide future investigations on the non-equilibrium dynamics of vesicles under osmotic stress.\n",
      "Cholesterol is necessary for the function of many G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). We find that cholesterol is not just necessary but also sufficient to activate signaling by the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, a prominent cell-cell communication system in development. Cholesterol influences Hh signaling by directly activating Smoothened (SMO), an orphan GPCR that transmits the Hh signal across the membrane in all animals. Unlike most GPCRs, which are regulated by cholesterol through their heptahelical transmembrane domains, SMO is activated by cholesterol through its extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD). Residues shown to mediate cholesterol binding to the CRD in a recent structural analysis also dictate SMO activation, both in response to cholesterol and to native Hh ligands. Our results show that cholesterol can initiate signaling from the cell surface by engaging the extracellular domain of a GPCR and suggest that SMO activity may be regulated by local changes in cholesterol abundance or accessibility.\n",
      "Epigenetic modifications play a key role in gene regulation and in recognition of self DNA in bacteria. In-spite of their positive role in cell survival, modifications like cytosine methylation incur a mutational cost. Cytosine methylation, specifically 5-methylcytosine, is prone to hydrolytic deamination which leads to C [-&gt;] T and G [-&gt;] A transitions. Here, we first study the abundance of mutagenic cytosine methylation target motifs and show that bacteria like Vibrio cholerae might use motif avoidance as a strategy to minimize the mutational effect of deamination of methylated cytosine. Second by performing SNP analysis on whole genome sequence data from Vibrio cholerae patient isolates we show a) high abundance of cytosine methylation-dependent mutations in the cytosine methylation target motif RCCGGY, b) 95% of these C [-&gt;] T and G [-&gt;] A transitions in the coding region lead to non-synonymous substitutions and c) many of these transitions are associated with membrane proteins and are implicated in virulence. Thus, our SNP analysis of V. cholerae genomes implicates the role of cytosine methylation in generating genotypic diversity with adaptive potential.\n",

Previously, as facilitated with our discovery in 2005 that \\\"completely insoluble\\\" proteins could be all solubilized in unsalted water [Song (2009) FEBS Lett. 583: 953], we found that the TDP-43 prion-like domain in fact contains an intrinsic membrane-interacting subdomain [Lim et al. [2016] PLoS Biol. 14, e1002338]. We decrypted that ALS-causing mutations/cofactor-depletion act to render the wellstructured folds of cytosolic VAPB-MSP domain and SOD1 into highly disordered states, thus becoming buffer-insoluble. Most surprisingly, this also unlocks the amphiphilic/hydrophobic regions universally exiting in proteins, which thus acquire a novel capacity in abnormally interacting with membranes [Qin et al. (2013) F1000Res 2-221.v2; Lim (2016) BBA-Biomembranes. 1858: 2223]. Here we aimed extend our discovery to address two fundamental questions: 1) why many E. coli proteins become aggregated in aging; and 2) whether aggregation-prone proteins can also acquire a novel capacity in interacting with membranes; by dissecting the 557-residue S1 ribosomal protein into 7 fragments to disrupt its 6 S1 folds, followed by extensive CD and NMR characterizations. The results reveal that we have successfully eliminated all 6 S1 folds and fragment 4 becomes highly disordered and thus buffer-insoluble. Most strikingly, F4 does acquire a capacity in transforming into a helical conformation in membrane environments. Here, for the first time, our study deciphers that like ALScausing mutants, the disruption of a well-folded E. coli cytosolic protein also unlocks its amphiphilic/hydrophobic regions which are capable of abnormally interacting with membranes. Therefore, proteins, the most important functional players for all forms of life, can transform into membrane-toxic forms triggering diseases and aging, if their hydrophobic/amphiphilic regions are unlocked by genetic, pathological or/and environmental factors, which is characteristic of severe aggregation.\n",
      "Proteins that are components of the secretory machinery form a cellular pathway of paramount importance for physiological regulation, development and function of human tissues. Consistently, most secretory pathway components are ubiquitously expressed in all tissues. At the same time, recent studies identified that the largest fraction of tissue-specific proteins consists of secreted and membrane proteins and not intracellular proteins. This suggests that the secretory pathway is distinctively regulated in a tissue-specific fashion. However, a systematic analysis on how the protein secretory pathway is tuned in different tissues is lacking, and it is even largely unexplored if the secretome and membrane proteome differs in, for example, posttranslation modifications across tissues. Here, analyzing publically available transcriptome data across 30 human tissues, we discovered the expression level of key components previously categorized as housekeeping proteins were specifically over-expressed in a certain tissue compared with the average expression of their corresponding secretory pathway subsystem (e.g. protein folding). These extreme genes define an exceptional fine-tuning in specific subnetworks, which neatly differentiated for example the pancreas and liver from 30 other tissues. Moreover, the subnetwork expression tuning correlated with the nature and number of post translational modification sites in the pancreas or liver-specific secretome and membrane proteome. These patterns were recurrently observed also in other tissues, like the blood, the brain and the skeletal muscle. These findings conciliate both the housekeeping and tissue-specific nature of the protein secretory pathway, which we attribute to a fine-tuned regulation of defined subnetworks in order to support the diversity of secreted proteins and their modifications.\n",
      "Mathematical modelling provides a useful framework within which to investigate the organization of biological tissues. With advances in experimental biology leading to increasingly detailed descriptions of cellular behaviour, models that consider cells as individual objects are becoming a common tool to study how processes at the single-cell level affect collective dynamics and determine tissue size, shape and function. However, there often remains no comprehensive account of these models, their method of solution, computational implementation or analysis of parameter scaling, hindering our ability to utilise and accurately compare different models. Here we present an effcient, open-source implementation of the immersed boundary method (IBM), tailored to simulate the dynamics of cell populations. This approach considers the dynamics of elastic membranes, representing cell boundaries, immersed in a viscous Newtonian fluid. The IBM enables complex and emergent cell shape dynamics, spatially heterogeneous cell properties and precise control of growth mechanisms. We solve the model numerically using an established algorithm, based on the fast Fourier transform, providing full details of all technical aspects of our implementation. The implementation is undertaken within Chaste, an open-source C++ library that allows one to easily change constitutive assumptions. Our implementation scales linearly with time step, and subquadratically with mesh spacing and immersed boundary node spacing. We identify the relationship between the immersed boundary node spacing and fluid mesh spacing required to ensure fluid volume conservation within immersed boundaries, and the scaling of cell membrane stiffness and cell-cell interaction strength required when refining the immersed boundary discretization. This study provides a recipe allowing consistent parametrisation of IBM models.\n",
      "A most important property of biochemical systems is robustness. Static robustness, e.g., homeostasis, is the insensitivity of a state against perturbations, whereas dynamics robustness, e.g., homeorhesis, is the insensitivity of a dynamic process. In contrast to the extensively studied static robustness, dynamics robustness, i.e., how a system creates an invariant temporal profile against perturbations, is little explored despite transient dynamics being crucial for cellular fates and are reported to be robust experimentally. For example, the duration of a stimulus elicits different phenotypic responses, and signaling networks process and encode temporal information. Hence, robustness in time courses will be necessary for functional biochemical networks. Based on dynamical systems theory, we uncovered a general mechanism to achieve dynamics robustness. Using a three-stage linear signaling cascade as an example, we found that the temporal profiles and response duration post-stimulus is robust to perturbations against certain parameters. Then analyzing the linearized model, we elucidated the criteria of how such dynamics robustness emerges in signaling networks. We found that changes in the upstream modules are masked in the cascade, and that the response duration is mainly controlled by the rate-limiting module and organization of the cascade's kinetics. Specifically, we found two necessary conditions for dynamics robustness in signaling cascades: 1) Constraint on the rate-limiting process: The phosphatase activity in the perturbed module is not the slowest. 2) Constraints on the initial conditions: The kinase activity needs to be fast enough such that each module is saturated even with fast phosphatase activity and upstream information is attenuated. We discussed the relevance of such robustness to several biological examples and the validity of the above conditions therein. Given the applicability of dynamics robustness to a variety of systems, it will provide a general basis for how biological systems function dynamically.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCells use signaling pathways to transmit information received on its membrane to DNA,and many important cellular processes are tied to signaling networks. Past experiments have shown that cells internal signaling networks are sophisticated enough to process and encode temporal information such as the length of time a ligand is bound to a receptor. However, little research has been done to verify whether information encoded onto temporal profiles can be made robust. We examined mathematical models of linear signaling networks and found that the relaxation of the response to a transient stimuli can be made robust to certain parameter fluctuations. Robustness is a key concept in 1/15 biological systems it would be disastrous if a cell could not operate if there was as light change in its environment or physiology. Our research shows that such dynamics robustness does emerge in linear signaling cascades, and we outline the design principles needed to generate such robustness. We discovered that two conditions regarding the speed of the internal chemical reactions and concentration levels are needed to generate dynamics robustness.\n",
      "Proteins associated with the bacterial membrane can be recruited for application as antigens for the development of vaccines. This preliminary study was directed towards evaluating the antigenic properties of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA01) pscC protein which is a component of the Type III secretion system. Gene specific primers were designed to isolate the pscC gene which was isolated, ligated onto the multiple cloning site of vector pGS21(a), cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21). The molecular weight of the expressed pscC protein was determined by SDS-PAGE (10% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and was found to be around 57 KDa and purified by the size exclusion chromatography. Finally, the purified pscC protein was injected subcutaneously into adult Sprague Dawley(R) rats with a range of concentrations (50, 100 and 150 {micro}g per rat) respectively. Recombinant pscC antigen induced a specific humoral immune response against the antigen, which was validated by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results concluded that anti-pscC antibody was elicited in the animal model.\n",
      "Integrins are transmembrane receptors that, upon activation, bind extracellular matrix (ECM) or cell surface ligands and link them to the actin cytoskeleton to mediate cell adhesion and migration1,2. One model for the structural transitions mediating integrin activation termed \\\"the cytoskeletal force hypothesis\\\" posits that force transmitted from the cytoskeleton to ligand-bound integrins acts as an allosteric stabilizer of the extended-open, high-affinity state3. Since cytoskeletal forces in migrating cells are generated by centripetal \\\"retrograde flow\\\" of F-actin from the cell leading edge, where integrin-based adhesions are initiated4,5, this model predicts that F-actin flow should align and orient activated, ligand-bound integrins in integrin-based adhesions. Here, polarization-sensitive fluorescence microscopy of GFP-V{beta}3 integrin chimeras in migrating fibroblasts shows that integrins are aligned with respect to the axis of FAs and the direction of F-actin flow, and this alignment requires binding immobilized ligand and talin-mediated linkage to a flowing cytoskeleton. Polarization imaging and Rosetta modelling of chimeras engineered to orient GFP differentially with respect to the integrin headpiece suggest that ligand-bound V{beta}3 integrin may be markedly tilted by the force of F-actin flow. These results show that actin cytoskeletal forces actively sculpt an anisotropic molecular scaffold in FAs that may underlie the ability of cells to sense directional ECM and physical cues.\n",
      "Integrin {beta} heterodimer cell surface receptors mediate adhesive interactions that provide traction for cell migration. Here, we test whether the integrin head, known from crystal structures, adopts a specific orientation dictated by the direction of actin flow on the surface of migrating cells. We insert GFP into the rigid head of the full integrin, model with Rosetta the orientation of GFP and its transition dipole relative to the integrin, and measure orientation with fluorescence polarization microscopy. Dependent on coupling to the cytoskeleton, integrins orient in the same direction as retrograde actin flow with their cytoskeleton-binding {beta}-subunits tilted by applied force. The measurements demonstrate that intracellular forces can orient cell surface integrins and support a molecular model of integrin activation by cytoskeletal force. We have developed a method that places atomic, ~[A] structures of cell surface receptors in the context of functional, cellular length-scale, ~m measurements and shows that rotation and tilt of cell surface receptors relative to the membrane plane can be restrained by interactions with other cellular components.\n",

      "De novo creation of protein coding genes involves formation of short ORFs from noncoding regions; some of these ORFs might then become fixed in the population. De novo created proteins need to, at the bare minimum, not cause serious harm to the organism, meaning that they should for instance not cause aggregation. Therefore, although the creation of the short ORFs could be truly random, but the fixation should be of subject to some selective pressure. The selective forces acting on de novo created proteins have been elusive and contradictory results have been reported. In Drosophila they are more disordered, i.e. are enriched in polar residues, than ancient proteins, while the opposite trend is present in yeast. To the best of our knowledge no valid explanation for this difference has been proposed.\\n\\nTo solve this riddle we studied structural properties and age of all proteins in 187 eukaryotic species. We find that, on average, there are small differences between proteins of different ages, with the exception that younger proteins are shorter. However, when we take the GC content into account we find that this can explain the opposite trends observed in yeast (low GC) and drosophila (high GC). GC content is correlated with codons coding for disorder-promoting amino acids, and inversely correlated with transmembrane, helix and sheet promoting residues. We find that for the youngest proteins, i.e. the ones that are most likely to be de novo created, there exists a strong correlation with GC and structural properties. In contrast, this strong relationship is not seen for ancient proteins. This leads us to propose that structural features are not a strong determining factor for fixation of de novo created genes. Instead these proteins resemble random proteins given a particular GC level. The dependency on GC content is then gradually weakened during evolution.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe show that the GC content of a genomic area is of great importance for the properties of a protein-coding de novo created gene. The GC content affects the frequency of the codons and this affects the probability for each amino acid to be included in a de novo created protein. The codons encoding for Ala, Pro and Glu contain 80% GC, while codons for Lys, Phe, Asn, Tyr and Ile contain 20% or less. Pro and Gly are disorder-promoting, while Phe, Tyr and Ile are order-promoting. Therefore random protein sequences at a high GC will be more disordered than the ones created at a low GC. The structural properties of the youngest (orphan) proteins match to a large degree the properties of random proteins when the GC content is taken into account. In contrast structural properties of ancient proteins only show a weak correlation with GC content. This suggests that even after fixation of de novo created proteins largely resemble random proteins given a certain GC content. Thereafter, during evolution the correlation between structural properties and GC weakens.\n",
      "The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized neuronal compartment that plays a key role in neuronal development and excitability. It concentrates multiple ion channels and cell adhesion molecules. The anchoring of these AIS membrane components is known to be highly dependent of the scaffold protein ankyrin G (ankG) but whether ankG membrane partners play a reciprocal role in ankG targeting and stabilization has not been studied yet. In cultured hippocampal neurons and cortical organotypic slices, we found that shRNA-mediated knockdown of ankG membrane partners led to a decrease of ankG concentration and perturbed the AIS formation and maintenance. These perturbations were rescued by expressing an AIS-targeted sodium channel, or a minimal construct containing the ankyrin-binding domain of Nav1.2 and a membrane anchor. We thus demonstrate that a tight and precocious association of ankG to its membrane partners is crucial for the establishment and maintenance of the AIS.\n",
      "MotivationProtein contacts contain key information for the understanding of protein structure and function and thus, contact prediction from sequence is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem, but the predicted contacts for proteins without many sequence homologs is still of low quality and not extremely useful for de novo structure prediction.\\n\\nMethodThis paper presents a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both evolutionary coupling (EC) and sequence conservation information through an ultra-deep neural network formed by two deep residual neural networks. The first residual network conducts a series of 1-dimensional convolutional transformation of sequential features; the second residual network conducts a series of 2-dimensional convolutional transformation of pairwise information including output of the first residual network, EC information and pairwise potential. By using very deep residual networks, we can model contact occurring patterns and very complex sequence-structure relationship and thus, obtain high-quality contact prediction regardless of how many sequence homologs are available for proteins in question.\\n\\nResultsOur method greatly outperforms existing methods and leads to much more accurate contact-assisted folding.

In the recent blind CAMEO benchmark, our fully-automated web server implementing this method successfully folded 4 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs, including one {beta} protein of 182 residues, one +{beta} protein of 125 residues, one  protein of 140 residues and one  protein of 217 residues.\\n\\nAvailability: http://raptorx.uchicago.edu/ContactMap/\\n\\nAuthor SummaryProtein contact prediction from sequence alone is an important problem. Recently exciting progress has been made on this problem due to the development of direct evolutionary coupling analysis (DCA). However, DCA is effective on only some proteins with a very large number (>1000) of sequence homologs. To further improve contact prediction, we borrow ideas from the latest breakthrough of deep learning, a powerful machine learning technique that has recently revolutionized object recognition, speech recognition and the GO game. We have developed a new deep learning method that predicts contacts by integrating both sequence conservation and co-variation information through an ultra-deep neural network, which can model very complex relationship between sequence and contact map as well as high-order correlation among residues.\\n\\nOur test results suggest that deep learning can revolutionize protein contact prediction. Tested on 398 membrane proteins, the L/10 long-range accuracy obtained by our method is 77.6% while that by the state-of-the-art methods CCMpred and MetaPSICOV is 51.8% and 61.2%, respectively. Ab initio folding using our predicted contacts as restraints can generate much better 3D structural models than the other contact prediction methods. In particular, without using any force fields our predicted contacts yield correct folds for 203 of the 579 test proteins, while MetaPSICOV- and CCMpred can do so for only 79 and 62 of them, respectively. Our contact-assisted models also have much better quality than template-based models (TBM) built from the training proteins. For example, our contact-assisted models have TMscore>0.5 for 208 of the 398 membrane proteins while TBMs have TMscore >0.5 for only 10 of them. Even without using any membrane proteins to train our deep learning models, our method still performs very well on membrane protein contact prediction. Recent blind test of our method in CAMEO shows that our method successfully folded 4 targets with a new fold and only 0.3L-2.3L effective sequence homologs.\n",
      "RNA granules are non-membrane bound cellular compartments that contain RNA and RNA binding proteins. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the spatial distribution of RNA granules in cells are poorly understood. During polarization of the C. elegans zygote, germline RNA granules, called P granules, assemble preferentially in the posterior cytoplasm. We present evidence that P granule asymmetry depends on RNA-induced phase separation of the granule scaffold MEG-3. MEG-3 is an intrinsically disordered protein that binds and phase separates with RNA in vitro. In vivo, MEG-3 forms a posterior-rich concentration gradient that is anti-correlated with a gradient in the RNA-binding protein MEX-5. MEX-5 is necessary and sufficient to suppress MEG-3 granule formation in vivo, and suppresses RNA-induced MEG-3 phase separation in vitro. Our findings support a model whereby MEX-5 functions as an mRNA sink to locally suppress MEG-3 phase separation and drive P granule asymmetry.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTS- The intrinsically-disordered protein MEG-3 is essential for localized assembly of P granules in C. elegans zygotes.\\n- MEG-3 binds RNA and RNA stimulates MEG-3 phase separation.\\n- The RNA-binding protein MEX-5 inhibits MEG-3 granule assembly in the anterior cytoplasm by sequestering RNA.\n",
      "The immune system of vertebrate species consists of many different cell types that have distinct functional roles and are subject to different evolutionary pressures. Here, we first analysed gene conservation of all major immune cell types in human and mouse. Our results revealed higher gene turnover and faster evolution of trans-membrane proteins in NK cells compared to other immune cell populations, and especially T cells, but similar conservation of nuclear and cytoplasmic protein coding genes. To validate these findings in a distant vertebrate species, we used single-cell RNA-Sequencing of lck:GFP cells in zebrafish to obtain the first transcriptome of specific immune cell types in a non-mammalian species. Unsupervised clustering and single-cell TCR locus reconstruction identified three cell populations, T-cells, a novel type of NK-like cells and a smaller population of myeloid-like cells. Differential expression analysis uncovered new immune cell specific genes, including novel immunoglobulin-like receptors, and neofunctionalization of recently duplicated paralogs. Evolutionary analyses confirmed a higher gene turnover and lower conservation of trans-membrane proteins in NK cells compared to T cells in fish species, suggesting that this is a general property of immune cell types across all vertebrates.\n",
      "Microsporidia are fungi-related intracellular pathogens that may infect virtually all animals, but are poorly understood. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. N. parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. In addition, we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus. Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora. Interestingly, unlike Nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida. Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia, narrow for others: indeed, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species, and conversely. We also show that N. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response. Altogether, these newly isolated species illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes, and provide a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMicrosporidia are microbial parasites that live inside their host cells and can cause disease in humans and many other animals. The small nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a convenient model host for studying microsporidian infections. In this work, we sample Caenorhabditis and other small nematodes and 47 associated microsporidian strains from the wild. We characterize the parasites for their position in the evolutionary tree of microsporidia and for their lifecycle and morphology. We find several new species and genera, especially some that are distantly related to the previously known Nematocida parisii and instead closely related to human pathogens. We find that some of these species have a narrow host range. We studied two species in detail using electron microscopy and uncover a new likely mode of exit from the host cell, by budding off the host cell plasma membrane rather than by fusion of a vesicle to the plasma membrane as in N. parisii. We also find a new species that infects the epidermis and muscles of Caenorhabditis rather than the host intestinal cells and is closely related to human pathogens. Finally, we find that one Nematocida species fails to elicit the same host response that other Nematocida species do. These new microsporidia open up many windows into microsporidia biology and opportunities to investigate host-parasite coevolution in the C. elegans system.\n",
      "Methanotrophic bacteria are important soil biofilters for the climate-active gas methane. The prevailing opinion is that these bacteria exclusively metabolise single-carbon, and in limited instances, short-chain hydrocarbons for growth. This specialist lifestyle juxtaposes metabolic flexibility, a key strategy for environmental adaptation of microorganisms. Here we show that a methanotrophic bacterium from the phylum Verrucomicrobia oxidises hydrogen gas (H2) during growth and persistence. Methylacidiphilum sp. RTK17.1 expresses a membrane-bound hydrogenase to aerobically respire molecular H2 at environmentally significant concentrations. While H2 oxidation did not support growth as the sole electron source, it significantly enhanced mixotrophic growth yields under both oxygen-replete and oxygen-limiting conditions and was sustained in non-growing cultures starved for methane. We propose that H2 is consumed by this bacterium for mixotrophic growth and persistence in a manner similar to other non-methanotrophic soil microorganisms. We have identified genes encoding oxygen-tolerant uptake hydrogenases in all publicly-available methanotroph genomes, suggesting that H2 oxidation serves a general strategy for methanotrophs to remain energised in chemically-limited environments.\n",
      "Diffusion and interaction dynamics of molecules at the plasma membrane play an important role in cellular signalling. These have been suggested to be strongly associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we utilise super-resolution STED microscopy combined with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (STED-FCS) to access the sub-diffraction diffusion regime of different fluorescent lipid analogues and GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) in the cellular plasma membrane, and compare it to the diffusion regime of these molecules in cell-derived actin-free giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs). We show that phospholipids and sphingomyelin, which undergo hindered diffusion in the live cell membrane, diffuse freely in the GPMVs. In contrast to sphingomyelin, which is transiently trapped on molecular-scale complexes in intact cells, diffusion of the ganglioside lipid GM1 suggests transient incorporation into nanodomains, which is less influenced by the actin cortex. Finally, our data on GPI-APs indicate two molecular pools in living cells, one pool showing high mobility with trapped and compartmentalized diffusion, and the other forming immobile clusters both of which disappear in GPMVs. Our data underlines the crucial role of the actin cortex in maintaining hindered diffusion modes of most but not all membrane molecules.\n",
      "Glycolysis is central to energy metabolism in most organisms, and is highly regulated to enable optimal growth. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, feedback mechanisms that control flux through glycolysis span transcriptional control to metabolite levels in the cell. Using a cellobiose consumption pathway, we decoupled glucose sensing from carbon utilization, revealing new modular layers of control that induce ATP consumption to drive rapid carbon fermentation. Alterations of the beta subunit of phosphofructokinase (PFK2), H+-plasma membrane ATPase (PMA1), and glucose sensors (SNF3, RGT2) revealed the importance of coupling extracellular glucose sensing to manage ATP levels in the cell. Controlling the upper bound of cellular ATP levels may be a general mechanism used to regulate energy levels in cells, via a regulatory network that can be uncoupled from ATP concentrations under perceived starvation conditions.\\n\\nImportanceLiving cells are fine-tuned through evolution to thrive in their native environments. Genome alterations to create organisms for specific biotechnological applications may result in unexpected and undesired phenotypes. We used a minimal synthetic biological system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a platform to reveal novel connections between carbon sensing, starvation conditions and energy homeostasis.\n",

      "Planctomycetes are distinguished from other Bacteria by compartmentalization of cells via internal membranes, interpretation of which has been subject to recent debate regarding potential relations to Gram-negative cell structure. In our interpretation of the available data, the planctomycete Gemmata obscuriglobus contains a nuclear body compartment, and thus possesses a type of cell organization with parallels to the eukaryote nucleus. Here we show that pore-like structures occur in internal membranes of G.obscuriglobus and that they have elements structurally similar to eukaryote nuclear pores, including a basket, ring-spoke structure, and eight-fold rotational symmetry. Bioinformatic analysis of proteomic data reveals that some of the G. obscuriglobus proteins associated with pore-containing membranes possess structural domains found in eukaryote nuclear pore complexes. Moreover, immuno-gold labelling demonstrates localization of one such protein, containing a {beta}-propeller domain, specifically to the G. obscuriglobus pore-like structures. Finding bacterial pores within internal cell membranes and with structural similarities to eukaryote nuclear pore complexes raises the dual possibilities of either hitherto undetected homology or stunning evolutionary convergence.\n",
      "Niemann Pick C disease (NPC) is an autosomal recessive disorder that leads to excessive storage of cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomes and lysosomes. The large majority of NPC disease is caused by mutations in NPC1, a large polytopic membrane protein that functions in late endosomes. There are many disease-associated mutations in NPC1, and most patients are compound heterozygotes. The most common mutation NPC1I1061T has been shown to cause endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation of the NPC1 protein. Treatment of patient derived NPC1I1061T fibroblasts with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) Vorinostat or Panobinostat increases expression of the mutant NPC1 protein and leads to correction of the cholesterol storage. Herein we show that several other human NPC1 mutant fibroblast cell lines can also be corrected by Vorinostat or Panobinostat and that treatment with Vorinostat extends the lifetime of the NPC1I1061T protein. To test effects of HDACi on a large number of NPC1 mutants, we engineered a U2OS cell line to suppress NPC1 expression by shRNA and then transiently transfected these cells with 81 different NPC1 mutant constructs. The mutant NPC1 did not significantly reduce cholesterol accumulation, but approximately 80% of the mutants showed reduced cholesterol accumulation when treated with Vorinostat or Panobinostat.\n",

      "Lipid packing is a crucial feature of cellular membranes. Quantitative analysis of membrane lipid packing can be achieved using polarity sensitive probes whose emission spectrum depends on the lipid packing. However, detailed insight into the exact mechanism that causes the spectral shift is essential to interpret the data correctly. Here, we analysed frequently used polarity sensitive probes, Laurdan and di-4-ANEPPDHQ, to test whether the underlying physical mechanisms of their spectral shift is the same, thus whether they report on the same physico-chemical properties of the cell membrane. Their steady-state spectra as well as time-resolved emission spectra in solvents and model membranes showed that they probe different properties of the lipid membrane. Our findings are important for the application of these dyes in cell biology.\n",
      "How bacteria produce a septum to divide in two is not well understood. This process is mediated by periplasmic cell-wall producing enzymes that are positioned by filaments of the cytoplasmic membrane-associated actin FtsA and the tubulin FtsZ (FtsAZ). To understand how these components act in concert to divide cells, we visualized their movements relative to the dynamics of cell wall synthesis during cytokinesis. We find that the division septum is built at discrete sites that move around the division plane. Furthermore, FtsAZ filaments treadmill in circumferential paths around the division ring, pulling along the associated cell-wall-synthesizing enzymes. We show that the rate of FtsZ treadmilling controls both the rate of cell wall synthesis and cell division. The coupling of both the position and activity of the cell wall synthases to FtsAZ treadmilling guides the progressive insertion of new cell wall, synthesizing increasingly small concentric rings to divide the cell.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryBacterial cytokinesis is controlled by circumferential treadmilling of FtsAZ filaments that drives the insertion of new cell wall.\n",
      "In-vivo angiogenesis process is highly conserved and is mediated through a family of peptides having VEGF-A as the lead member. A respective receptor family comprising of members VEGFR-1, 2, 3 gets expressed on the endothelial cell membrane of the vascular bed in ischemic zone along with parallel expressions of VEGF-A, B, C, D and PlGF. Degree of ischaemia is the main regulator of these coupled expressions of angiogenic peptides/factors (AFs) and respective receptor(s) for a paracrine angiogenic process to take place. Physiological angiogenesis in intrauterine growth phase is the lead process in foetal growth, organogenesis and cellular specialization. Post birth and with aging, this process gets gradually inefficient and slow. In the present in-silico study, all angiogenic factors and receptor species are examined as for their binding stability in basal unaided condition and in presence of a possible Low-Mol-Wt linkage molecule-Lysine. Also a Lysine analogue 1,6-diaminohexanoic acid has been examined for its angiogenic potential both in dry docking experiment and in cell culture assay.\n",
      "BackgroundTo cause an economically important blast disease on rice, the filamentous fungus Magnaporthe oryzae forms a specialized infection structure, called an appressorium, to penetrate host cells. Once inside host cells, the fungus produces a filamentous primary hypha that differentiates into multicellular bulbous invasive hyphae (IH), which are surrounded by a host-derived membrane. These hyphae secrete cytoplasmic effectors that enter host cells presumably via the biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC). The first IH cell, also known as the side BIC-associated cell, is a specialized effector-secreting cell essential for a successful infection. This study aims to determine cellular processes that lead to the development of this effector-secreting first IH cell inside susceptible rice cells.\\n\\nResultsUsing live-cell confocal imaging, we determined a series of cellular events by which the appressorium gives rise to the first IH cell in live rice cells. The filamentous primary hypha extended from the appressorium and underwent asymmetric swelling at its apex. The single nucleus in the appressorium divided, and then one nucleus migrated into the swollen apex. Septation occurred in the filamentous region of the primary hypha, establishing the first IH cell. The tip BIC that was initially associated with the primary hypha becomes the side BIC on the swollen apex prior to nuclear division in the appressorium. The average distance between the early side BIC and the nearest nucleus in the appressorium was estimated to be more than 32 {micro}m. These results suggest an unknown mechanism by which effectors that are expressed in the appressorium are transported through the primary hypha for their secretion to the distantly located BIC. When M. oryzae was inoculated on heat-killed rice cells, penetration proceeded as normal, but there was no differentiation of a bulbous IH cell, suggesting its specialization for establishment of biotrophic infection.\\n\\nConclusionsOur studies reveal cellular dynamics associated with the development of the effector-secreting first IH cell. Our data raise new mechanistic questions concerning hyphal differentiation in response to host environmental cues and effector trafficking from the appressorium to the BIC.\n",
      "Lipid bilayers constitute the basis of biological membranes. Understanding lipid mixing and phase behavior can provide important insights into membrane lateral organization (the \\\"raft\\\" hypothesis). Here we investigate model lipid bilayers below and above their miscibility transition temperatures. Molecular dynamics simulations with the MARTINI coarse-grained force field are employed to model bilayers on a length scale approaching 100 nm and a time scale of tens of microseconds. Using a binary mixture of saturated and unsaturated lipids, and a ternary mixture of a saturated lipid, an unsaturated lipid and cholesterol we reproduce the coexistence of liquid-crystalline and gel, as well as liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered phases. By raising the temperature or adding hybrid lipids (with a saturated and an unsaturated chain), we induce a gradual transition from a two-phase to a one-phase state. We characterize the evolution of bilayer properties along this transition. Domains of coexisting phases change to dynamic heterogeneity with local ordering and compositional de-mixing. We analyze the structural and dynamic properties of domains, sizes and lifetimes of composition fluctuations, and calculate the in-plane structure factors.\n",
      "A wide range of liver diseases manifest as biliary obstruction, or cholestasis. However, the sequence of molecular events triggered as part of the early hepatocellular homeostatic response to abnormal elevations in biliary pressure remains poorly elucidated. Bile canaliculi are dynamic luminal structures that undergo actomyosin-mediated periodic contractions to propel secreted bile. Additionally, pericanalicular actin is accumulated during obstructive cholestasis. Therefore, we hypothesize that the pericanalicular actin cortex undergoes significant remodeling as a regulatory response against increased biliary pressure. Here, we report that, actomyosin contractility induces transient deformations along the canalicular membrane, a process we have termed inward blebbing. We show that these membrane intrusions are initiated by local ruptures in the pericanalicular actin cortex, and they typically retract following repair by actin polymerization and actomyosin contraction. However, above a certain osmotic pressure threshold, these inward blebs pinch away from the canalicular membrane into the hepatocyte cytoplasm as large vesicles (2-8 {micro}m). Importantly, we show that these vesicles aid in the regurgitation of bile from the canalicular system. Conclusion: Actomyosin contractility induces the formation of bile-regurgitative vesicles, thus serving as an early homeostatic mechanism against increased biliary pressure during cholestasis.\n",
      "Axons contain an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network that is largely smooth and tubular, thought to be continuous with ER throughout the neuron, and distinct in form and function from rough ER; the mechanisms that form this continuous network in axons are not well understood. Mutations affecting proteins of the reticulon or REEP families, which contain intramembrane hairpin domains that can model ER membranes, cause an axon degenerative disease, hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). Here, we show that these proteins are required for modeling the axonal ER network in Drosophila. Loss of reticulon or REEP proteins can lead to expansion of ER sheets, and to partial loss of ER from distal motor axons. Ultrastructural analysis reveals an extensive ER network in every axon of peripheral nerves, which is reduced in larvae that lack reticulon and REEP proteins, with defects including larger and fewer tubules, and occasional gaps in the ER network, consistent with loss of membrane curvature. Therefore HSP hairpin-containing proteins are required for shaping and continuity of the axonal ER network, suggesting an important role for ER modeling in axon maintenance and function.\n",

      "The thalamus or \\\"inner chamber\\\" of the brain is divided into ~30 discrete nuclei, with highly specific patterns of afferent and efferent connectivity. To identify genes that may direct these patterns of connectivity, we used two strategies. First, we used a bioinformatics pipeline to survey the predicted proteomes of nematode, fruitfly, mouse and human for extracellular proteins containing any of a list of motifs found in known guidance or connectivity molecules. Second, we performed clustering analyses on the Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas data to identify genes encoding surface proteins expressed with temporal profiles similar to known guidance or connectivity molecules. In both cases, we then screened the resultant genes for selective expression patterns in the developing thalamus. These approaches identified 82 candidate connectivity labels in the developing thalamus. These molecules include many members of the Ephrin, Eph-receptor, cadherin, protocadherin, semaphorin, plexin, Odz/teneurin, Neto, cerebellin, calsyntenin and Netrin-G families, as well as diverse members of the immunoglobulin (Ig) and leucine-rich receptor (LRR) superfamilies, receptor tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, a variety of growth factors and receptors, and a large number of miscellaneous membrane-associated or secreted proteins not previously implicated in axonal guidance or neuronal connectivity. The diversity of their expression patterns indicates that thalamic nuclei are highly differentiated from each other, with each one displaying a unique repertoire of these molecules, consistent with a combinatorial logic to the specification of thalamic connectivity.\n",

Simulations can be performed at single molecule and compartment spatial scales simultaneously. Molecules can diffuse and react in 1D (filament), 2D (membrane) and 3D (cytosol) compartments. The implications of crowded regions in the cell can be investigated because each diffusing molecule has spatial dimensions. Spatiocyte adopts multi-algorithm and multi-timescale frameworks to simulate models that simultaneously employ deterministic, stochastic and particle reaction-diffusion algorithms. Comparison of light microscopy images to simulation snapshots is supported by Spatiocyte microscopy visualization and molecule tagging features.

      "The twin arginine translocation (Tat) system is an integral membrane protein complex that accomplishes the remarkable feat of transporting large, fully-folded polypeptides across the inner membrane of bacteria, into the periplasm. In Escherichia coli Tat is comprised of three membrane proteins: TatA, TatB and TatC. How these proteins arrange themselves in the inner membrane to permit passage of Tat substrates, whilst maintaining membrane integrity, is still poorly understood. TatA is the most abundant component of this complex and facilitates assembly of the transport mechanism. We have utilised immunogold labelling in combination with array tomography to gain insight into the localisation and distribution of the TatA protein in E. coli cells. We show that TatA exhibits a uniform distribution throughout the inner membrane of E. coli and that altering the expression of TatBC shows a previously uncharacterised distribution of TatA in the inner membrane. Array tomography was used to provide our first insight into this altered distribution of TatA in 3D space, revealing that this protein forms linear clusters in the inner membrane of E. coli upon increased expression of TatBC. This is the first indication that TatA organisation in the inner membrane alters in response to changes in Tat subunit stoichiometry.\\n\\nSummary statementThe volumetric electron-microscopy technique, array tomography, revealed a novel distribution of TatA protein (from the twin arginine translocase complex), in Escherichia coli.\n",
      "The primary protein of the bacterial Z ring guiding cell division, FtsZ, has recently been shown to engage in intriguing self-organization together with one of its natural membrane anchors, FtsA. When co-reconstituted on flat supported membranes, these proteins assemble into dynamic chiral vortices whose diameters resemble the cell circumference. These dynamics are due to treadmilling polar FtsZ filaments, supposedly destabilized by the co-polymerizing membrane adaptor FtsA, thus catalysing their turnover. Here we show that FtsA is in fact dispensable and that the phenomenon is an intrinsic property of FtsZ alone when supplemented with a membrane anchor. The emergence of these chiral dynamic patterns is critically dependent on GTP concentration and FtsZ surface densities, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The interplay of membrane tethering, GTP binding, and hydrolysis promotes both, the assembly and the destabilization of FtsZ polymers, leading to the observed treadmilling dynamics. Notably, the vortex chirality is defined by the position of the membrane targeting sequence (mts) and can be inverted when attaching it to the opposite end of FtsZ. This reveals a so far unknown vectorial character of these cytomotive filaments, comprising three orthogonal directions: Filament polarity, curvature, and membrane attachment.\n",
      "Although specific genes have been found to be associated with skin pigmentation, the global gene expression profile for the early stage of skin pigmentation and development in mammals is still not well understood. Here we reported a rare natural group of goat (Youzhou dark goat) featuring the dark skin of body including the visible mucous membranes, which may be an exclusive kind of large mammalian species with this special phenotype so far. In the present study, we characterized the 100-day-old fetal skin transcriptome in hyperpigmented (dark-skinned) and wild-type (white-skinned) goats using deep RNA-sequencing. A total of 923,013,870 raw reads from 6 libraries were obtained, and a large number of alternative splicing events were identified in the transcriptome of fetal skin, including the well-known melanogenic genes ASIP, TYRP1, and DCT, which were differentially expressed in the skin between the dark-skinned and white-skinned goats. Further analysis demonstrated that differential genes including ASIP, TYRP1, DCT, WNT2, RAB27A, FZD4, and CREB3L1 were significantly overrepresented in the melanogenesis pathway and several biological process associated with pigmentation. On the other hand, we identified 1616 novel transcripts in goat skin based on the characteristics of their expression level and gene composition. These novel transcripts may represent two distinct groups of nucleic acid molecules. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the characteristics of global gene expression at early stages of skin pigmentation and development, as well as describe an animal model for human diseases associated with pigmentation.\n",
      "Globally, the area of angiogenesis is dominated by investigations on anti-angiogenic agents and processes, due to its role in metastatic cancer treatment. Although, the area of ischemic tissue reperfusion is having much bigger demand and foot-mark. Following clinical failure of VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor) as a potential agent for induction of a controlled angiogenic response in ischemic tissues and organs, the progress is reasonably quiet as for new low molecular weight (LMW) angiogen molecules and their clinical applications are concerned. Basic amino acid Lysine has been observed to have profound angiogenic property in ischemic tissues, which is controlled, reproducible, time bound and without any accompanying reperfusion damage. In this study, the basic amino acid Lysine has been suggested as a LMW-angiogen, where it has been proposed to have a molecular binding property between VEGF and VEGF receptor (VEGFR). Here, the molecular adhesive hypothesis is being probed and confirmed both in the clinical and lab conditions through induced angiogenic response in tissue repair and in chick chorio allantoic membrane (CAM), respectively; and in dry-docking experiments (in-silico studies).\n",

In humans, Plasmodium infections have caused hundreds of millions of documented deaths, imposing strong selection on certain populations and driving the emergence of several resistance alleles. Over the deep timescale of mammalian evolution, however, little is known about host adaptation to Plasmodium. In this work, we expand the collection of known Plasmodium-interacting-proteins (PIPs) in mammalian hosts from ~10 to 410, by manually curating thousands of scientific abstracts. We use comparative tests of adaptation to show that PIPs have experienced >3 times more positive selection than similar mammalian proteins, consistent with Plasmodium as a major and long-standing selective pressure. PIP adaptation is strongly linked to gene expression in the blood, liver, and lung, all of which are clinically relevant tissues in Plasmodium infection. Interestingly, we find that PIPs with immune functions are especially enriched for additional interactions with viruses or bacteria, which together drive a 3.7-fold excess of adaptation. These pleiotropic interactions with unrelated pathogens, along with pressure from other Plasmodium-like Apicomplexan parasites, may help explain the PIP adaptation we observe in all clades of the mammalian tree. As a case study, we also show that alpha-spectrin, the major membrane component of mammalian red blood cells, has experienced accelerated adaptation in domains known to interact specifically with Plasmodium proteins. Similar interactions with Plasmodium-like parasites appear to have driven substantial adaptation in hundreds of host proteins throughout mammalian evolution.\n",

      "Oscillatory synchrony among neurons occurs in many species and brain areas, and has been proposed to help neural circuits process information. One hypothesis states that oscillatory input creates cyclic integration windows: specific times in each oscillatory cycle when postsynaptic neurons become especially responsive to inputs. With paired local field potential (LFP) and intracellular recordings and controlled stimulus manipulations we directly tested this idea in the locust olfactory system. We found that inputs arriving in Kenyon cells (KCs) sum most effectively in a preferred window of the oscillation cycle. With a computational model, we found that the non-uniform structure of noise in the membrane potential helps mediate this process. Further experiments performed in vivo demonstrated that integration windows can form in the absence of inhibition and at a broad range of oscillation frequencies. Our results reveal how a fundamental coincidence-detection mechanism in a neural circuit functions to decode temporally organized spiking.\n",

      "It remains a mystery how dominantly inherited mutations in the housekeeping gene GARS, which encodes glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS), mediate selective peripheral nerve toxicity resulting in the currently incurable Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D). A recent study identified the transmembrane receptor protein neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) as a substrate for aberrant extracellular binding of mutant GlyRS. Formation of the Nrp1/mutant GlyRS complex antagonises the interaction of Nrp1 with one of its main natural ligands, vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), contributing to neurodegeneration. Reduced binding of Nrp1 to VEGF-A is known to disrupt blood vessel development and growth. We therefore analysed capillary architecture at early and later symptomatic time points in CMT2D mouse muscles, retina, and sciatic nerve, as well as in embryonic hindbrain. Assessing capillary diameter, density, and branching, we observed no differences between wild-type and mutant animals from embryonic development to three months, spanning the duration over which numerous sensory and neuromuscular phenotypes manifest. This work indicates that mutant GlyRS-mediated disruption of Nrp1/VEGF-A signalling is permissive to capillary maturation and maintenance in CMT2D mice.\\n\\nSummary StatementAlthough the multi-functional neuropilin 1/VEGF-A signalling pathway is impaired by dominant pathogenic GlyRS variants, the vascular system remains unperturbed in Gars mutant mice.\n",
      "Type IVa pili are protein filaments essential for virulence in many bacterial pathogens; they extend and retract from the surface of bacterial cells to pull the bacteria forward with unprecedented force. They are used for attachment, swarming and twitching motility, biofilm formation, up-regulation of other virulence factors, and natural competence. The pilus is assembled by the motor subcomplex which consists of the inner membrane protein PilC and the cytoplasmic ATPase PilB. How PilB catalyzes this process is unknown, due in part to the lack of high-resolution structural information. Phylogenetic analysis of PilB-like ATPases, including GspE, PilT, BfpD, FlaI, and archaeal GspE2 revealed highly conserved residues essential for function in this family of ATPases. Here we report the structure of the core ATPase domains of Geobacter metalloreducens PilB bound to ADP and the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue, AMPPNP, at 3.4 and 2.3[A], respectively. Importantly, these structures were determined in non-saturating nucleotide conditions, revealing important differences in nucleotide binding between chains. Analysis of these differences revealed the sequential turnover of nucleotide by the chains, and the corresponding domain movements. Our data indicate a clockwise rotation of movement in PilB, which would support the assembly of a right-handed helical pilus. Conversely, our analysis suggests a counterclockwise rotation in PilT that would enable right-handed pilus disassembly. The proposed model provides insight into how this family of ATPases can power pilus extension and retraction with extraordinary forces.\n",
      "Neurons extend processes that vary in number, length, and direction of outgrowth. Extracellular cues help determine outgrowth patterns. In Caenorhabditis elegans, neurons respond to the extracellular UNC-6 (netrin) cue via UNC-40 (DCC) and UNC-5 (UNC5) receptors. Previously we presented evidence that UNC-40 asymmetric localization at the plasma membrane is self-organizing and that UNC-40 can localize and mediate outgrowth at randomly selected sites. We also postulate that the process is statistically dependent, i.e. if the probability of outgrowth at one site changes then the probability at another site(s) must also change. Over time, the direction of outgrowth activity fluctuates across the membrane. A probability distribution describes the likelihood of outgrowth in each direction. Random walk modeling predicts that the degree to which the direction of outgrowth fluctuations affects the outward displacement of the membrane. We predict that extracellular cues create patterns of outgrowth by differentially affecting the degree to which the direction of outgrowth activity fluctuates along the membrane. This produces different rates of outgrowth along the surface and creates patterns of extension. Here we present evidence that UNC-5 (UNC5) receptor activity regulates UNC-40 asymmetric localization and the patterning of outgrowth. We show that unc-5 mutations alter UNC-40 asymmetric localization and the patterns of outgrowth that neurons develop. Genetic interactions suggest UNC-5 acts through the UNC-53 (NAV2) cytoplasmic protein to regulate UNC-40 asymmetric localization in response to both the UNC-6 and EGL-20 (wnt) extracellular cues.\n",

      "Dynamic microtubule ends exert pulling and pushing forces on intracellular membranes and organelles. However, the mechanical linkage of microtubule tips to their cargoes is poorly understood. CENP-F is a non-motor microtubule-binding protein that participates in microtubule binding at kinetochores and in the mitotic redistribution of the mitochondrial network. CENP-F-driven mitochondrial transport is linked to growing microtubule tips, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that CENP-F tracks growing microtubule ends in living cells. In vitro reconstitution demonstrates that microtubule tips can transport mitochondria and CENP-F-coated artificial cargoes over micrometer-long distances, during both growing and shrinking phases. Based on these and previous observations, we suggest that CENP-F might act as a transporter of mitochondria and other cellular cargoes by attaching them to dynamic microtubule ends.\n",
      "The self-assembly of HIV-1 Gag polyprotein at the inner leaflet of the cell host plasma membrane is the key orchestrator of virus assembly. The binding between Gag and the plasma membrane is mediated by specific interaction of the Gag matrix domain and the PI(4,5)P2 lipid (PIP2). It is unknown whether this interaction could lead to local reorganization of the plasma membrane lipids. In this study, using model membranes, we examined the ability of Gag to segregate specific lipids upon self-assembly. We show for the first time that Gag self-assembly is responsible for the formation of PIP2 lipid nanoclusters, enriched in cholesterol but not in sphingomyelin. We also show that Gag mainly partition into liquid-disordered domains of these lipid membranes. Our work strongly suggests that, instead of targeting pre-existing plasma membrane lipid domains, Gag is more prone to generate PIP2/Cholesterol lipid nanodomains at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane during early events of virus assembly.\n",
      "Despite much effort to probe the properties of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution, effects of DMSO on water, especially near plasma membrane surfaces still remain elusive. By performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at varying DMSO concentrations (XDMSO), we study how DMSO affects structural and dynamical properties of water in the vicinity of phospholipid bilayers. As proposed by a number of experiments, our simulations confirm that DMSO induces dehydration from bilayer surfaces and disrupts the H-bond structure of water. However, DMSO enhanced water diffusivity at solvent-bilayer interfaces, an intriguing discovery reported by a spin-label measurement, is not confirmed in our simulations. In order to resolve this discrepancy, we examine the location of the spin-label (Tempo), relative to the solvent-bilayer interface. In accord with the evidence in the literature, our simulations, which explicitly model Tempo-PC, find that the Tempo moiety is equilibrated at ~ 8 - 10 [A] below the bilayer surface. Furthermore, the DMSO-enhanced surface water diffusion is confirmed only when water diffusion is analyzed around the Tempo moiety that is immersed below the bilayer surface, which implies that the experimentally detected signal of water using Tempo stems from the interior of bilayers, not from the interface. Our analysis finds that the increase of water diffusion below the bilayer surface is coupled to the increase of area per lipid with an increasing XDMSO ([lsim] 10 mol%). Underscoring the hydrophobic nature of Tempo moiety, our study calls for careful re-evaluation of the use of Tempo in the measurement on lipid bilayer surfaces.\n",

      "We investigated the role of Na+/Ca2+ exchange (NCX) in the refilling of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ in vascular endothelial cells under various conditions of cell stimulation and plasma membrane (PM) polarization. Better understanding of the mechanisms behind basic ER Ca2+ content regulation is important, since current hypotheses on the possible ultimate causes of ER stress point to deterioration of the Ca2+ transport mechanism to/from ER itself. We measured [Ca2+]i temporal changes by Fura-2 fluorescence under experimental protocols that inhibit a host of transporters (NCX, Orai, non-selective transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels, sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA), Na+/K+ ATPase (NKA)) involved in the Ca2+ communication between the extracellular space and the ER. Following histamine-stimulated ER Ca2+ release, blockade of NCX Ca2+-influx mode (by 10 {micro}M KB-R7943) diminished the ER refilling capacity by about 40%, while in Orai1 dominant negative-transfected cells NCX blockade attenuated ER refilling by about 60%. Conversely, inhibiting the high-ouabain-affinity NKA (10 nM ouabain), which may be localized in PM-ER junctions, increased the ER Ca2+ releasable fraction by about 20%, thereby supporting the hypothesis that this process of privileged ER refilling is junction-mediated. Junctions were observed in the cell ultrastructure and their main parameters of membrane separation and linear extension were (9.6 {+/-} 3.8) nm and (128 {+/-} 63) nm, respectively. Our findings point to a process of privileged refilling of the ER, in which NCX and SOCE via the stromal interaction molecule (STIM)-Orai system are the sole protagonists. These results shed light on the molecular machinery involved in the function of a previously hypothesized subplasmalemmal Ca2+ control unit during ER refilling with extracellular Ca2+.\n",
      "To facilitate high-throughput proteomic analyses we have developed a modified FASP protocol which improves the rate at which protein samples can be processed prior to mass spectrometry. Adapting the original FASP protocol to a 96-well format necessitates extended spin times for buffer exchange due to the low centrifugation speeds tolerated by these devices. However, by using 96-well plates with a more robust polyethersulfone molecular weight cutoff membrane, instead of the cellulose membranes typically used in these devices, we could use isopropanol as a wetting agent, decreasing spin times required for buffer exchange from an hour to 30 minutes. In a typical work flow used in our laboratory this equates to a reduction of 3 hours per plate. To test whether our modified protocol produced similar results to FASP and other FASP-like protocols we compared the performance of our modified protocol to the original FASP and the more recently described eFASP and MStern-blot. We show that all FASP-like methods, including our modified protocol, display similar performance in terms of proteins identified and reproducibility. Our results show that our modified FASP protocol is an efficient method for the high-throughput processing of protein samples for mass spectral analysis.\n",
      "A change of the input resistance (Rin) of the neuron involves a change in the membrane conductances by opening and closing of ion channels. In passive membranes, i.e., membranes with only linear leak conductances, the increase or decrease of these conductances leads to a decrease or increase of the Rin and the membrane time constant ({tau}m). However, the presence of subthreshold voltage dependent currents can produce non-linear effects generating deviations from this relationship, especially the contradictory effect of negative conductances, as produced by the sodium-persistent current (INaP), on the Rin. In this work we aimed to analyze experimentally and theoretically the impact of the negative conductance produced by INaP on Rin. Experiments of whole-cell patch-clamp conducted in CA1 hippocampus pyramidal cells from brain slices showed a paradoxical voltage-dependent decrease of the Rin and the {tau}m in subthreshold membrane potentials close to the firing threshold after the perfusion with TTX, which inhibits INaP. This effect is postulated to be a result of the negative slope conductance in the subthreshold region produced by this conductance. The analysis of the experimental data, together with simulations found that the slope conductance of INaP is negative for subthreshold membrane potentials and its magnitude is voltage dependent in the same range observed for the voltage-dependence of Rin and {tau}m. The injection of an artificial INaP using dynamic-clamp in the presence of TTX restored the Rin and {tau}m to its original values. Additionally the injection of an artificial leak current with a negative conductance in the presence of TTX restored the Rin and {tau}m as the artificial Inap did. On the other hand, the injection of an artificial leak current with a positive conductance in the presence of TTX had no effect on the Rin and {tau}m. We conclude that INaP increases the Rin and {tau}m by the negative slope conductance observed in its non-monotonic I-V relationship. These results demonstrate that the effect of Inap on Rin and {tau}m is stronger in potentials near the firing threshold, which could potentiate the temporal summation of the EPSPs increasing their temporal integration and facilitating action potential firing. Because of its negative slope conductance, INaP is more effective in increasing excitability near threshold than a depolarizing leak current.\n",
      "Outer membrane vesicles are microvesicles shed by Gram-negative bacteria and play important roles in immune priming and disease pathogenesis. However, our current mechanistic understanding of vesicle - host cell interactions is limited by a lack of methods to study the kinetics of vesicle entry and cargo delivery to host cells in real-time. Here, we describe a highly sensitive method to study the kinetics of vesicle entry into host cells in real-time using a genetically encoded probe targeted to vesicles. We found that route of vesicular uptake, and thus entry kinetics and efficiency of cargo release, are determined by the chemical composition of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide. The presence of O-antigen facilitates receptor-independent entry, which enhances both rate and efficiency of cargo uptake by host cells. Collectively, our findings highlight the chemical composition of the bacterial cell wall as a major determinant of secretion-independent delivery of virulence factors during Gram-negative infections.\n",
      "All cells respond to osmotic challenges, including those imposed during normal growth and development. Mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels provide a conserved mechanism for regulating osmotic forces by conducting ions in response to increased membrane tension. We previously demonstrated that the MS ion channel MscS-Like 8 (MSL8) is required for pollen to survive multiple osmotic challenges that occur during the normal process of fertilization, and that it can inhibit pollen germination. However, it remained unclear whether these physiological functions required ion flux through a mechanically gated channel provided by MSL8. We introduced two point mutations into the predicted pore-lining domain of MSL8 that disrupted normal channel function in different ways. The Ile711Ser mutation increased the tension threshold of the MSL8 channel while leaving conductance unchanged, and the Phe720Leu mutation severely disrupted the MSL8 channel. Both of these mutations impaired the ability of MSL8 to preserve pollen viability during hydration and to maintain the integrity of the pollen tube when expressed at endogenous levels. When overexpressed in a msl8-4 null background, MSL8I711S could partially rescue loss-of-function phenotypes, while MSL8F720L could not. When overexpressed in the wild type Ler background, MSL8I711S suppressed pollen germination, similar to wild type MSL8. In contrast, MSL8F720L failed to suppress pollen germination and increased pollen bursting, thereby phenocopying the msl8-4 mutant. Thus, an intact MSL8 channel is required to for normal pollen function during hydration and germination. These data establish MSL8 as the first plant MS channel to fulfill previously established criteria for assignment as a mechanotransducer.\n",

      "Flying lizards of the genus Draco are famous for their gliding ability, using an aerofoil formed by winglike patagial membranes and supported by elongated thoracic ribs. It has remained unknown, however, how the lizards manoeuvre during flight. Here, I show that the patagium is deliberately grasped and controlled by the forelimbs while airborne. This type of composite wing is unique inasmuch as the lift-generating and the controlling units are formed independently by different parts of the body and are connected to each other only for the duration of the flight. The major advantage for the lizards is that the forelimbs keep their entire movement range and functionality for climbing and running when they are not used as the controlling unit of the wing. These findings not only shed a new light on the flight of Draco lizards but also have implications for the interpretation of gliding performance in fossil species.\n",
      "Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a co-inhibitory receptor that suppresses T cell activation and is an important cancer immunotherapy target. Upon activation by its ligand PD-L1, PD-1 is thought to suppress signaling through the T cell receptor (TCR). Here, by titrating the strength of PD-1 signaling in both biochemical reconstitution systems and in T cells, we demonstrate that the coreceptor CD28 is strongly preferred over the TCR as a target for dephosphorylation by PD-1- recruited Shp2 phosphatase. We also show that PD-1 colocalizes with the costimulatory receptor CD28 in plasma membrane microclusters but partially segregates from the TCR. These results reveal that PD-1 suppresses T cell function primarily by inactivating CD28 signaling, suggesting that costimulatory pathways may play unexpected roles in regulating effector T cell function and therapeutic responses to anti-PD-L1/PD-1.\n",
      "The fast blood stream of animals is associated with large shear stresses. Consequently, blood cells have evolved a special morphology and a specific internal architecture allowing them to maintain their integrity over several weeks. For instance, non-mammalian red blood cells, mammalian erythroblasts and platelets have a peripheral ring of microtubules, called the marginal band, that flattens the overall cell morphology by pushing on the cell cortex. In this article, we model how the shape of these cells stems from the balance between marginal band elasticity and cortical tension. We predict that the diameter of the cell scales with the total microtubule polymer, and verify the predicted law across a wide range of species. Our analysis also shows that the combination of the marginal band rigidity and cortical tension increases the ability of the cell to withstand forces without deformation. Finally, we model the marginal band coiling that occurs during the disc-to-sphere transition observed for instance at the onset of blood platelet activation. We show that when cortical tension increases faster than crosslinkers can unbind, the marginal band will coil, whereas if the tension increases slower, the marginal band may shorten as microtubules slide relative to each other.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMany blood cells have a discoidal shape, which is essential for them to function properly within the organism. For some cells, such as blood platelets, this shape is due to the interplay between the elasticity of the marginal band, which is a closed ring of stiff filaments called microtubules, and the tension of the cell cortex, a polymer scaffold associated with the plasma membrane. Dmitrieff et al. examined how cell size is determined by the mechanical balance between these two components. Remarkably, the theory is confirmed over nearly three orders of magnitudes, by data collected from 25 species. The theory also shows how the composite structure is adapted to resist transient mechanical challenges, as encountered in the blood stream.\n",
      "The highly variable spiking of a cortical neuron is \\\"coupled\\\" to that of other neurons in the network. This has implications for sensory coding, and appears to represent a fundamental property of cortical sensory processing. To date, most studies of population coupling have focused on recorded spiking activity, an approach that suffers from several confounding issues. Moreover, the contributions of various network properties to population coupling are largely unexplored. To this end, we recorded the membrane potential (V) and the nearby LFP in the visual cortex of the turtle ex vivo wholebrain preparation during ongoing and visually-evoked activity. We used an algorithm to infer the excitatory conductance (g) from V, and calculated the g-LFP coupling. We found that g-LFP coupling was highly variable across neurons, and increased following visual stimulation before relaxing to intermediate values. To investigate the role of the network, we implemented a driven small-world network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. This model reproduces the large across-trial response variability and g-LFP coupling dynamic, and suggests crucial roles for anatomical and emergent network properties.\n",
      "Cortical sensory responses are highly variable across stimulus presentations. This variability can be correlated across neurons (due to some combination of dense intracortical connectivity, cortical activity level, and cortical state), with fundamental implications for population coding. Yet the interpretation of correlated response variability (or \\\"noise correlation\\\") has remained fraught with difficulty, in part because of the restriction to extracellular neuronal spike recordings. Here, we measured response variability and its correlation at the most microscopic level of electrical neural activity, the membrane potential, by obtaining dual whole-cell recordings from pairs of cortical pyramidal neurons during visual processing. We found that during visual stimulation, correlated variability adapts towards an intermediate level and that this correlation dynamic is mediated by intracortical mechanisms. A model network with external inputs, synaptic depression, and structure reproduced the observed dynamics of correlated variability. These results establish that intracortical adaptation self-organizes cortical circuits towards a balanced regime at which network coordination maintains an intermediate level.\n",

      "A primary goal of systems neuroscience is to understand cortical function, which typically involves studying spontaneous and sensory-evoked cortical activity. Mounting evidence suggests a strong and complex relationship between the ongoing and evoked state. To date, most work in this area has been based on spiking in populations of neurons. While advantageous in many respects, this approach is limited in scope; it records the activities of a minority of neurons, and gives no direct indication of the underlying subthreshold dynamics. Membrane potential recordings can fill these gaps in our understanding, but are difficult to obtain in vivo. Here, we record subthreshold cortical visual responses in the ex vivo turtle eye-attached whole-brain preparation, which is ideally-suited to such a study. In the absence of visual stimulation, the network is \\\"synchronous\\\"; neurons display network-mediated transitions between low- and high-conductance membrane potential states. The prevalence of these slow-wave transitions varies across turtles and recording sessions. Visual stimulation evokes similar high-conductance states, which are on average larger and less reliable when the ongoing state is more synchronous. Responses are muted when immediately preceded by large, spontaneous high-conductance events. Evoked spiking is sparse, highly variable across trials, and mediated by concerted synaptic inputs that are in general only very weakly correlated with inputs to nearby neurons. Together, these results highlight the multiplexed influence of the cortical network on the spontaneous and sensory-evoked activity of individual cortical neurons.\n",
      "In this paper we present the optical characterisations of diabetic red blood cells (RBCs) in a non-invasive manner employing three-dimensional (3-D) quantitative phase imaging. By measuring 3-D refractive index tomograms and 2-D time-series phase images, the morphological (volume, surface area and sphericity), biochemical (haemoglobin concentration and content) and mechanical (membrane fluctuation) parameters were quantitatively retrieved at the individual cell level. With simultaneous measurements of individual cell properties, systematic correlative analyses on retrieved RBC parameters were also performed. Our measurements show that diabetic patients had RBCs of reduced cell sphericity and elevated intracellular haemoglobin concentration and content compared to healthy (non-diabetic) subjects. Furthermore, membrane deformability of diabetic RBCs is significantly lower than that of healthy, non-diabetic RBCs. Interestingly, non-diabetic RBCs exhibit strong correlations between the elevated glycated haemoglobin in RBC cytoplasm and decreased cell deformability, whereas diabetic RBCs do not show correlations. Our observations strongly support the idea that slow and irreversible glycation of haemoglobin and membrane proteins of RBCs by hyperglycaemia significantly compromises RBC deformability in diabetic patients.\n",
      "When starved, the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis forms durable spores for survival. Sporulation initiates with an asymmetric cell division, creating a large mother cell and a small forespore. Subsequently, the mother cell membrane engulfs the forespore in a phagocytosis-like process. However, the force generation mechanism for forward membrane movement remains unknown. Here, we show that membrane migration is driven by cell wall remodeling at the leading edge of the engulfing membrane, with peptidoglycan synthesis and degradation mediated by penicillin binding proteins in the forespore and a cell wall degradation protein complex in the mother cell. We propose a simple model for engulfment in which the junction between the septum and the lateral cell wall moves around the forespore by a mechanism resembling the  template model. Hence, we establish a biophysical mechanism for the creation of a force for engulfment based on the coordination between cell wall synthesis and degradation.\n",
      "Serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) is a powerful method to analyze cells in 3D. Here, working at the resolution limit of the method, we describe a correlative light-SBF-SEM workflow to resolve microtubules of the mitotic spindle in human cells. We present three examples of uses for this workflow which are not practical by light microscopy and/or TEM. First, distinguishing closely associated microtubules within K-fibers; second, resolving bridging fibers in the mitotic spindle; third, visualizing membranes in mitotic cells, relative to the spindle apparatus. Our workflow also includes new computational tools for exploring the spatial arrangement of MTs within the mitotic spindle. We use these tools to show that microtubule order in mitotic spindles is sensitive to the level of TACC3 on the spindle.\n",
      "Type IV pili (T4aP) are ubiquitous microbial appendages used for adherence, twitching motility, DNA uptake, and electron transfer. Many of these functions depend on dynamic assembly and disassembly of the pilus by a megadalton-sized, cell envelope-spanning protein complex located at the poles of rod-shaped bacteria. How the T4aP assembly complex becomes integrated into the cell envelope in the absence of dedicated peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolases is unknown. After ruling out potential involvement of housekeeping PG hydrolases in installation of the T4aP machinery in P. aeruginosa, we discovered that key components of inner (PilMNOP) and outer (PilQ) membrane subcomplexes are recruited to future sites of cell division. Mid-cell recruitment of a fluorescently tagged alignment subcomplex component, mCherry-PilO, depended on PilQ secretin monomers - specifically, their N-terminal PG-binding AMIN domains. PilP, which connects PilO to PilQ, was required for recruitment, while PilM, which is structurally similar to divisome component FtsA, was not. Recruitment preceded secretin oligomerization in the outer membrane, as loss of the PilQ pilotin, PilF, had no effect on localization. These results were confirmed in cells chemically blocked for cell division prior to outer membrane invagination. The hub protein FimV and a component of the Polar Organelle Coordinator complex - PocA - were independently required for mid-cell recruitment of PilO and PilQ. Together, these data reveal an integrated, energy-efficient strategy for the targeting and pre-installation - rather than retrofit - of the T4aP system into nascent poles, without the need for dedicated PG-remodelling enzymes.\n",

      "1Azole antifungal drugs target CYP51A in Aspergillus fumigatus by binding with the active site of the protein, blocking ergosterol biosynthesis. Resistance to azole anti-fungal drugs is now common, with a leucine to histidine amino acid substitution at position 98 the most frequent, conferring resistance to itraconazole. In this study, we create a homology model of CYP51A using a recently published crystal structure of the paralog protein CYP51B. The derived structures, wild-type and L98H mutant, are positioned within a lipid membrane bilayer and subjected to molecular dynamics simulations in order improve the accuracy of both models. The structural analysis from our simulations suggests a decrease in active site surface from the formation of hydrogen bonds between the histidine substitution and neighbouring polar side chains, potentially preventing the binding of azole drugs. This study yields a biologically relevant structure and set dynamics of the A. fumigatus Lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase enzyme and provides further insight into azole antifungal drug resistance.\n",
      "The herpesvirus process of primary envelopment and de-envelopment as viral particles exit the nucleus has been for many years one of the least understood steps in the virus life cycle. Though viral proteins such as pUL31, pUL34, pUS3 and others are clearly important, these are likely insufficient for efficient fusion with the nuclear membrane. We postulated that host nuclear membrane proteins involved in virus nuclear egress would move from the inner to outer nuclear membranes due to membrane fusion events in primary envelopment and de-envelopment and then diffuse into the endoplasmic reticulum. Membrane fractions were prepared enriched in the nuclear envelope or the endoplasmic reticulum with and without HSV-1 infection and analyzed by mass spectrometry, revealing several vesicle fusion proteins as candidates in the viral nuclear egress pathway. Knockdown of three of these, VAPB, Rab11b, and Rab18, significantly reduced titers of released virus while yielding nuclear accumulation of encapsidated particles. Antibody staining revealed that VAPB visually accumulates in the inner nuclear membrane during HSV-1 infection. VAPB also co-localizes at early time points with the viral pUL34 protein known to be involved in nuclear egress. Most strikingly, VAPB was also observed on HSV-1 virus particles by immunogold labelling electron microscopy. Thus, these data reveal several new host cell vesicle fusion proteins involved in viral nuclear egress.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHuman herpesviruses are associated with common human diseases such as chicken pox, shingles and mononucleosis and infect a wide range of animals making them economically important pathogens for livestock. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is most commonly associated with cold sores, but is also the leading cause of blindness by infection in the Western world. All herpesviruses share many aspects of infection. As large nuclear replicating dsDNA viruses with capsid sizes too large to use the nuclear pores to exit the nucleus, they have evolved a complex mechanism for envelopment and de-envelopment of primary herpesvirus particles, but this critical step in the virus lifecycle remains poorly understood. We have identified several host cell vesicle fusion proteins, VAPB, Rab11b and Rab18 that appear to contribute to this step in the HSV-1 life cycle. VAPB accumulates at the nuclear envelope with the HSV-1 pUL34 protein important for viral nuclear egress. Knockdown of any of these vesicle fusion proteins reduces viral titers, further arguing that they are important for nuclear egress. As there appears to be a specific subset of vesicle fusion proteins involved in viral egress, they could possibly represent novel targets for therapeutic interventions.\n",
      "Sphingolipids are membrane lipids, which are globally required for eukaryotic life. Sphingolipid composition varies among endomembranes with pre- and post-Golgi compartments being poor and rich in sphingolipids, respectively. Thanks to this different sphingolipid content, pre- and post-Golgi membranes serve different cellular functions. Nevertheless, how subcellular sphingolipid levels are maintained in spite of trafficking and metabolic fluxes is only partially understood. Here we describe a homeostatic control circuit that controls sphingolipid levels at the trans Golgi network. Specifically, we show that sphingomyelin production at the trans Golgi network triggers a signalling reaction leading to PtdIns(4)P dephosphorylation. Since PtdIns(4)P is required for cholesterol, and sphingolipid transport to the trans Golgi network, PtdIns(4)P consumption leads to the interruption of this transport in response to excessive sphingomyelin production. Based on this evidence we envisage a model where this homeostatic circuit maintains the sphingolipid composition of trans Golgi network and thus of post-Golgi compartments constant, against instant fluctuations in the sphingolipid biosynthetic flow.\n",
      "Voltage-dependent conductances in many spiking neurons are tuned to reduce action potential energy consumption, so improving the energy efficiency of spike coding. However, the contribution of voltage-dependent conductances to the energy efficiency of analogue coding, by graded potentials in dendrites and non-spiking neurons, remains unclear. We investigate the contribution of voltage-dependent conductances to the energy efficiency of analogue coding by modelling blowfly R1-6 photoreceptor membrane. Two voltage-dependent delayed rectifier K+ conductances (DRs) shape the membrane's voltage response and contribute to light adaptation. They make two types of energy saving. By reducing membrane resistance upon depolarisation they convert the cheap, low bandwidth membrane needed in dim light to the expensive high bandwidth membrane needed in bright light. This investment of energy in bandwidth according to functional requirements can halve daily energy consumption. Second, DRs produce negative feedback that reduces membrane impedance and increases bandwidth. This negative feedback allows an active membrane with DRs to consume at least 30% less energy than a passive membrane with the same capacitance and bandwidth. Voltage gated conductances in other non-spiking neurons, and in dendrites, might be organized to make similar savings.\n",
      "The germ cells of multicellular organisms protect their developmental potential through specialized mechanisms. A shared feature of germ cells from worms to humans is the presence of non-membrane-bound ribonucleoprotein organelles called germ granules. Depletion of germ granules in Caenorhabditis elegans (i.e., P granules) leads to sterility and in some germlines expression of the neuronal transgene unc-119::gfp and the muscle myosin MYO-3. Thus, P granules are hypothesized to maintain germ cell totipotency by preventing somatic development, although the mechanism by which P granules carry out this function is unknown. In this study, we performed transcriptome and single molecule RNA-FISH analyses of dissected P-granule-depleted gonads at different developmental stages. Our results demonstrate that P granules are necessary for adult germ cells to down-regulate spermatogenesis RNAs and to prevent the accumulation of numerous soma-specific RNAs. P-granule-depleted gonads that express the unc-119::gfp transgene also express many other genes involved in neuronal development and concomitantly lose expression of germ cell fate markers. Finally, we show that removal of either of two critical P-granule components, PGL-1 or GLH-1, is sufficient to cause germ cells to express UNC-119::GFP and MYO-3 and to display RNA accumulation defects similar to those observed after depletion of P granules. Our data identify P granules as critical modulators of the germline transcriptome and guardians of germ cell fate.\n",

      "The urokinase receptor (uPAR) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein that promotes tissue remodeling, tumor cell adhesion, migration and invasion. uPAR mediates degradation of the extracellular matrix through protease recruitment and enhances cell adhesion, migration and signaling through vitronectin binding and interactions with integrins and other receptors. Full-length uPAR is released from the cell surface, but the mechanism and functional significance of uPAR release remain obscure. Here we show that transmembrane glycerophosphodiesterase GDE3 is a GPI-specific phospholipase C that cleaves and releases uPAR with consequent loss of the proteolytic and non-proteolytic activities of uPAR. In breast cancer cells, high GDE3 expression depletes endogenous uPAR resulting in a less transformed phenotype, correlating with higher survival probability in patients. Our results establish GDE3 as a negative regulator of the uPAR signaling network and, more generally, highlight GPI-anchor hydrolysis as a cell-intrinsic mechanism to alter cell behavior.\n",

Databases collecting drug targets and gene annotations are growing and can be harnessed to shed a new light on psychiatric disorders. We used GWAS summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC) Schizophrenia working group and a repositioning model for schizophrenia by testing the enrichment of antipsychotics. As sample size increases, schizophrenia GWAS results show increasing enrichment for known antipsychotic drugs, selective calcium channel blockers, and antiepileptics. Each of these therapeutical classes targets different gene subnetworks. We identify 162 Bonferroni-significant druggable genes, and 128 FDR-significant biological pathways related to neurons, synapses, genic intolerance, membrane transport, epilepsy, and mental disorders. These results suggest that, in schizophrenia, current well-powered GWAS results can reliably detect known schizophrenia drugs and thus may hold considerable potential for the identification of new therapeutic leads. Moreover, antiepileptics and calcium channel blockers may provide repurposing opportunities. This study also reveals significant pathways in schizophrenia that were not identified previously, and provides a workflow for pathway analysis and drug repurposing using GWAS results.\n",

      "Subthreshold (membrane potential) resonance and phasonance (preferred amplitude and zero-phase responses to oscillatory inputs) in single neurons arise from the interaction between positive and negative feedback effects provided by relatively fast amplifying currents and slower resonant currents. In 2D neuronal systems, amplifying currents are required to be slaved to voltage (instantaneously fast) for these phenomena to occur. In higher dimensional systems, additional currents operating at various effective time scales may modulate and annihilate existing resonances and generate antiresonance (minimum amplitude response) and antiphasonance (zero-phase response with phase monotonic properties opposite to phasonance). We use mathematical modeling, numerical simulations and dynamical systems tools to investigate the mechanisms underlying these phenomena in 3D linear models, which are obtained as the linearization of biophysical (conductance-based) models. We characterize the parameter regimes for which the system exhibits the various types of behavior mentioned above in the rather general case in which the underlying 2D system exhibits resonance. We consider two cases: (i) the interplay of two resonant gating variables, and (ii) the interplay of one resonant and one amplifying gating variables. Increasing levels of an amplifying current cause (i) a response amplification if the amplifying current is faster than the resonant current, (ii) resonance and phasonance attenuation and annihilation if the amplifying and resonant currents have identical dynamics, and (iii) antiresonance and antiphasonance if the amplifying current is slower than the resonant current. We investigate the underlying mechanisms by extending the envelope-plane diagram approach developed in previous work (for 2D systems) to three dimensions to include the additional gating variable, and constructing the corresponding envelope curves in these envelope-space diagrams. We find that antiresonance and antiphasonance emerge as the result of an asymptotic boundary layer problem in the frequency domain created by the different balances between the intrinsic time constants of the cell and the input frequency f as it changes. For large enough values of f the envelope curves are quasi-2D and the impedance profile decrease with the input frequency. In contrast, for f << 1 the dynamics is quasi-1D and the impedance profile increases above the limiting value in the other regime. Antiresonance is created because the continuity of the solution requires the impedance profile to connect the portions belonging to the two regimes. If in doing so the phase profile crosses the zero value, then antiphasonance is also generated.\n",
      "In this study, we present a theoretical framework combining experimental characterizations and analytical calculus to capture the firing rate input-output properties of single neurons in the fluctuation-driven regime. Our framework consists of a two-step procedure to treat independently how the dendritic input translates into somatic fluctuation variables, and how the latter determine action potential firing. We use this framework to investigate the functional impact of the heterogeneity in firing responses found experimentally in young mice layer V pyramidal cells. We first design and calibrate in vitro a simplified morphological model of layer V pyramidal neurons with a dendritic tree following Rall's branching rule. Then, we propose an analytical derivation for the membrane potential fluctuations at the soma as a function of the properties of the synaptic input in dendrites. This mathematical description allows us to easily emulate various forms of synaptic input: either balanced, unbalanced, synchronized, purely proximal or purely distal synaptic activity. We find that those different forms of input activity lead to various impact on the membrane potential fluctuations properties, thus raising the possibility that individual neurons will differentially couple to specific forms of activity as a result of their different firing response. We indeed found such a heterogeneous coupling between synaptic input and firing response for all types of presynaptic activity. This heterogeneity can be explained by different levels of cellular excitability in the case of the balanced, unbalanced, synchronized and purely distal activity. A notable exception appears for proximal dendritic inputs: increasing the input level can either promote firing response in some cells, or suppress it in some other cells whatever their individual excitability. This behavior can be explained by different sensitivities to the speed of the fluctuations, which was previously associated to different levels of sodium channel inactivation and density. Because local network connectivity rather targets proximal dendrites, our results suggest that this aspect of biophysical heterogeneity might be relevant to neocortical processing by controlling how individual neurons couple to local network activity.\n",

      "Knowledge of adaptive processes encompasses understanding of the emergence of new genes. Computational analyses of genomes suggest that new genes can arise by domain swapping, however, empirical evidence has been lacking. Here we describe a set of nine independent deletion mutations that arose during the course of selection experiments with the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens in which the membrane-spanning domain of a fatty acid desaturase became translationally fused to a cytosolic di-guanylate cyclase (DGC) generating an adaptive phenotype. Detailed genetic analysis of one chimeric fusion protein showed that the DGC domain had become membrane-localised resulting in a new biological function. The relative ease by which this new gene arose along with its profound functional and regulatory effects provides a glimpse of mutational events and their consequences that are likely to play a significant role in the evolution of new genes.\n",

Recent crystal structures for the TREK-2 member of the K2P family reveal distinct \\\"up\\\" and \\\"down\\\" states assumed during activation via mechanical stretch. We performed 195 ps of all-atom, unbiased molecular dynamics simulations of the TREK-2 channel to probe how membrane stretch regulates the SF gate. Markov modeling reveals a novel \\\"pinched\\\" SF configuration that stretch activation rapidly destabilizes. Free-energy barrier heights calculated for critical steps in the conduction pathway indicate that this pinched state impairs ion conduction. Our simulations predict that this low-conductance state is accessed exclusively in the compressed, \\\"down\\\" conformation in which the intracellular helix arrangement allosterically pinches the SF. By explicitly relating structure to function, we contribute a critical piece of understanding to the evolving K2P puzzle.\n",
      "Alpha 1-6 fucosyltransferase (Fut8) is known for its properties as an enhancer of nonsmall cell lung cancer metastasis and as a suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hep3B). Promising candidates of affected molecules include E-cadherin. In its absence, during epithelial-mesenchymal transition, the pathway triggers signaling to the nucleus via {beta}-catenin-TCF/LEF. Contrarily, in less metastatic tumors, Fut8 stimulates cell-cell adhesion. Regulated classes of molecules could also include the sorting machinery of polarized epithelial cells, sorted ligands or both, that may be altered in cellular transformation. I have analyzed here the cargo receptor VIP36 (Vesicular-integral membrane protein of 36 kD) for carbohydrate interaction. It has been described as a lectin in the ERGIC (endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment), Golgi apparatus and plasma membrane. The docking reveals top-interacting carbohydrates of the N-glycan and O-glycan class that encompass N-linked glycans of high mannose and equally complex type which likely function as sorted ligands in epithelial cells. O-glycans score lower and include core 2 residue binding. I show that fucose core modifications by Fut8 stimulate binding of N-linked glycans to VIP36, which is known to be different from binding of galectins 3 and 9. This suggests that Fut8-upregulation may directly alter the affinity of sorted cargo and may enhance the sorting to the apical pathway as exemplified in hepatocytes and traffic to bile. High affinity binding of the ganglioside GM1 carbohydrate headgroup to VIP36 suggests a linkage with protein and glycosphingolipid apical transfer in epithelial cells. Thus, this fundamental approach with large scale docking of 165 carbohydrates including 19 N-glycan high mannose, 17 Nglycan hybrid, 9 N-glycan complex, 17 O-glycan core, 27 Sialoside, 25 Fucoside and 51 other glycan residues suggests, that linked cargo-receptor apical transport may provide a path to epithelial polarization that may be modulated by core fucosylation.\n",
      "Molecular assemblies can have highly heterogeneous dynamics within the cell, but the limitations of conventional fluorescence microscopy can mask nanometer-scale features. We have developed a novel, broadly applicable, fluorescent labeling and imaging protocol, called Single-molecule Recovery After Photobleaching (SRAP), which allowed us to reveal the heterogeneous dynamics of the eisosome, a multi-protein structure on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane in fungi. By fluorescently labeling only a small fraction of cellular Pil1p, the core eisosome BAR domain protein in fission yeast, we visualized whole eisosomes and, after photobleaching, recorded the binding of individual Pil1p molecules with ~20 nm precision. Further analysis of these dynamic structures and comparison to computer simulations allowed us to show that Pil1p exchange is spatially heterogeneous, supporting a new model of the eisosome as a dynamic filament.\\n\\nAbbreviations used\n",
      "Microbes produce metabolic resources that are important for cell growth yet leak across membranes into the extracellular environment. Other microbes in the same environment can use these resources and adjust their own metabolic production accordingly--causing other resources to leak into the environment. The combined effect of these processes is an economy in which organismal growth and metabolic production are coupled to others in the community. We propose a model for the co-evolving dynamics of metabolite concentrations, production regulation, and population frequencies for the case of two cell types, each requiring and capable of producing two metabolites. In this model, beneficial trade relations emerge without any coordination, via individual-level production decisions that maximize each cells growth rate given its perceived environment. As we vary production parameters of the model, we encounter three paradoxical behaviors, where a change that should intuitively benefit some cell type, actually harms it. (1) If a cell type is more efficient than its counterpart at producing a metabolite and becomes even more efficient, its frequency in the population can decrease. (2) If a cell type is less efficient than its counterpart at producing a metabolite but becomes less inefficient, the growth rate of the population can decrease. (3) Finally, if a cell type controls its counterparts production decisions so as to maximize its own growth rate, the ultimate growth rate it achieves can be lower than if the two cell types each maximized their own growth. These three paradoxes highlight the complex and counter-intuitive dynamics that emerge in simple microbial economies.\n",
      "Centrosomes are non-membrane-bound compartments that nucleate microtubule arrays. They consist of nanometer-scale centrioles surrounded by a micron-scale, dynamic assembly of protein called the pericentriolar material (PCM). To study how PCM forms a spherical compartment that nucleates microtubules, we reconstituted PCM-dependent microtubule nucleation in vitro using recombinant C.elegans proteins. We found that macromolecular crowding drives phase separation of the key PCM scaffold protein SPD-5 into spherical droplets that morphologically and dynamically resemble in vivo PCM. These SPD-5 droplets recruited the microtubule polymerase ZYG-9 (XMAP215 homologue) and the microtubule-stabilizing protein TPXL-1 (TPX2 homologue). Together, these three proteins concentrated tubulin ~4- fold over background, which was sufficient to reconstitute nucleation of microtubule asters in vitro. Our results suggest that in vivo PCM is a selective phase that organizes microtubule arrays through localized concentration of tubulin by microtubule effector proteins.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryPhase separation of C. elegans centrosome proteins drive the formation of micron-sized microtubule organizing centers.\n",
      "In a companion paper, we carried out a high-throughput screen to identify genes that suppressed cell-to-cell variability in signaling in yeast. Two genes affected cytoplasmic microtubules that can connect the nucleus to a signaling site on the membrane. Here, we show that microtubule perturbations that affected polymerization and depolymerization, membrane attachment, and force generation increased variability. For some perturbations, \\\"outlier\\\" cells drove the increased variability. Bypass experiments that activated the PRS ectopically at downstream points indicated that microtubule-dependent processes might stabilize the membrane-recruited scaffold protein Ste5. The variability caused by microtubule perturbations required the MAP kinase Fus3. Microtubule perturbations hindered stable scaffold formation and decreased the accuracy of a polarity-dependent fate choice. Our experiments suggest that membrane-attached microtubules stabilize signaling by scaffold-bound Fus3, and are consistent with a model in which signaling irregularities from changes in microtubule function are amplified by cross-stimulatory feedbacks among PRS proteins. The fact that microtubule perturbations also cause aberrant fate and polarity decisions during embryonic development and cancer initiation suggests that similar variation-reducing processes might also operate in metazoans.\n",

The capacity of these prevalently a-helical structures in mammals to influence membrane properties is poorly understood. Combining experiments with molecular dynamics simulations, we provide evidence that helical transmembrane peptides with their rough surface reduce lateral mobility of membrane constituents. The molecular mechanism involves trapping of lipid acyl chains on the rough surface and segregation of cholesterol from the vicinity of peptides. The observations are supported by our toy model indicating strong effect of rough objects on membrane dynamics. Herein described effect has implications for the organization and function of biological membranes, especially the plasma membrane with high cholesterol content.\n",

      "Bacterial cell division in many organisms involves a constricting cytokinetic ring that is orchestrated by the tubulin-like protein FtsZ. FtsZ forms dynamic filaments close to the membrane at the site of division that have recently been shown to treadmill around the division ring, guiding septal wall synthesis.\\n\\nHere, using X-ray crystallography of Staphylococcus aureus SaFtsZ we reveal how an FtsZ can adopt two functionally distinct conformations, open and closed. The open form is found in SaFtsZ filaments formed in crystals and also in soluble filaments of E. coli FtsZ as deduced by cryoEM. The closed form is found within several crystal forms of two non-polymerising SaFtsZ mutants and corresponds to many previous FtsZ structures from other organisms.\\n\\nWe argue that FtsZ undergoes a polymerisation-associated conformational switch. We show that such a switch provides explanations for both how treadmilling may occur within a single-stranded filament, and why filament assembly is cooperative.\n",
      "We evaluated the effectiveness of 2-phenylethanol (PET) in combination with acetic acid (AA) as a binary lure for monitoring male and female obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris). Studies were conducted in apple, Malus domestica Borkhausen, orchards treated with or without sex pheromone dispensers for mating disruption (MD). Open polypropylene vials, closed membrane cups, and rubber septa loaded with AA and/or PET in varying amounts were first evaluated in a series of trapping experiments. Membrane cups loaded with 800 mg of PET were as effective as 10-mg septa, but longer lasting, and were comparable to the open vials. A membrane cup AA lure was effective in tests, but further work is needed to increase its release rate and extend its activity. Catches of codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.), and C. rosaceana were unaffected by combining PET with (E,E)-8,10-dodecadien-1-ol, the sex pheromone of codling moth, pear ester, (E,Z)-2,4-ethyl-decadienoate, and AA lures. Adding (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene to this blend to enhance codling moth catch, significantly reduced catches of C. rosaceana. PET+AA was a more attractive binary lure than AA plus phenylacetonitrile (PAN) for C. rosaceana. The addition of PET or PAN to traps already baited with the sex pheromone of C. rosaceana significantly reduced male catches. Traps baited with PET+AA placed in blocks not treated with MD caught significantly fewer C. rosaceana than traps baited with sex pheromone. In comparison, sex pheromone-baited traps in MD blocks caught [&le;] 1 male moth per season which was significantly lower than total moth (> 10) or female moth ([&ge;] 3) catch in these blocks with PET+AA. A high proportion (> 70%) of trapped females were mated in both untreated and MD-treated orchards. Further refinement of this binary, bisexual lure using membrane cup technology may allow the establishment of action thresholds and improve management timings for C. rosaceana.\n",

      "Fractones are extracellular matrix structures in the neural stem cell niche of the subventricular zone (SVZ), where they appear as round deposits named bulbs or thin branching lines called stems. Their cellular origin and what determines their localization at this site is poorly studied and it remains unclear whether they influence neural stem and progenitor cells formation, proliferation and/or maintenance. To address these questions, we analyzed whole mount preparations of the lateral ventricle by confocal microscopy using different extracellular matrix and cell markers. We found that bulbs are rarely connected to stems and that they contain laminin 5 and 2 chains, respectively. Fractone bulbs were profusely distributed throughout the SVZ and appeared associated with the center of pinwheels, a critical site for adult neurogenesis. We demonstrate that bulbs appear at the apical membrane of ependymal cells at the end of the first week after birth. The use of transgenic mice lacking laminin 5 gene expression (Lama5) in endothelium and in FoxJ1-expressing ependymal cells, revealed ependymal cells as the source of laminin 5-containing fractone bulbs. Loss of laminin 5 from bulbs correlated with a 60% increase in cell proliferation, as determined by PH3 staining, and with a selective reduction in the number of quiescent neural stem cells in the SVZ. These results indicate that fractones are a key component of the SVZ and suggest that laminin 5 modulates the physiology of the neural stem cell niche.\\n\\nSignificance StatementOur work unveils key aspects of fractones, extracellular matrix structures present in the SVZ that still lack a comprehensive characterization. We show that fractones extensively interact with neural stem cells, whereas some of them are located precisely at pinwheel centers, which are hotspots for adult neurogenesis. Our results also demonstrate that fractones increase in size during aging and that their interactions with NSPCs become more complex in old mice. Lastly, we show that fractone bulbs are produced by ependymal cells and that their laminin content regulates neural stem cells.\n",

      "In Arabidopsis, development during flowering is coordinated by transport of the hormone auxin mediated by polar-localized PIN-FORMED1 (AtPIN1). However Arabidopsis has lost a PIN clade sister to AtPIN1, Sister-of-PIN1 (SoPIN1), which is conserved in flowering plants. We previously proposed that the AtPIN1 organ initiation and vein patterning functions are split between the SoPIN1 and PIN1 clades in grasses. Here we show that in the grass Brachypodium sopin1 mutants have organ initiation defects similar to Arabidopsis atpin1, while loss of PIN1 function in Brachypodium has little effect on organ initiation but alters stem growth. Heterologous expression of Brachypodium SoPIN1 and PIN1b in Arabidopsis provides further evidence of functional specificity. SoPIN1 but not PIN1b can mediate flower formation in null atpin1 mutants, although both can complement a missense allele. The behavior of SoPIN1 and PIN1b in Arabidopsis illustrates how membrane and tissue-level accumulation, transport activity, and interaction contribute to PIN functional specificity.\n",

      "ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are metabolic sensors that couple cell energetics to membrane excitability. In pancreatic {beta}-cells, channels formed by SUR1 and Kir6.2 regulate insulin secretion and are the targets of antidiabetic sulfonylureas. Here, we used cryo-EM to elucidate structural basis of channel assembly and gating. The structure, determined in the presence of ATP and the sulfonylurea glibenclamide, at ~6[A] resolution reveals a closed Kir6.2 tetrameric core with four peripheral SUR1s each anchored to a Kir6.2 by its N-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD0). Intricate interactions between TMD0, the loop following TMD0, and Kir6.2 near the proposed PIP2 binding site, and where ATP density is observed, suggest SUR1 may contribute to ATP and PIP2 binding to enhance Kir6.2 sensitivity to both. The SUR1-ABC core is found in an unusual inward-facing conformation whereby the two nucleotide binding domains are misaligned along a two-fold symmetry axis, revealing a possible mechanism by which glibenclamide inhibits channel activity.\n",

Here, we introduce FerriTag, a genetically-encoded chemically-inducible tag for correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM). FerriTag is a fluorescent recombinant electron-dense ferritin particle that can be attached to a protein-of-interest using rapamycin-induced heterodimerization. We demonstrate the utility of FerriTag for CLEM by labeling proteins associated with various intracellular structures including mitochondria, plasma membrane, and clathrin-coated pits and vesicles. FerriTagging has a high signal-to-noise ratio and a labeling resolution of 10 {+/-} 5 nm.

      "The understanding of genomic and physiological mechanisms related to how organisms living in extreme environments survive and reproduce is an outstanding question facing evolutionary and organismal biologists. One interesting example of adaptation is related to the survival of mammals in deserts, where extreme water limitation is common. Research on desert rodent adaptations has focused predominantly on adaptations related to surviving dehydration, while potential reproductive physiology adaptations for acute and chronic dehydration have been relatively neglected. This study aims to explore the reproductive consequences of acute dehydration by utilizing RNAseq data in the desert-specialized cactus mouse (Peromyscus eremicus). Specifically, we exposed 22 male cactus mice to either acute dehydration or control (fully hydrated) treatment conditions, quasimapped testes-derived reads to a cactus mouse testes transcriptome, and then evaluated patterns of differential transcript and gene expression. Following statistical evaluation with multiple analytical pipelines, nine genes were consistently differentially expressed between the hydrated and dehydrated mice. We hypothesized that male cactus mice would exhibit minimal reproductive responses to dehydration; therefore, this low number of differentially expressed genes between treatments aligns with current perceptions of this species extreme desert specialization. However, these differentially expressed genes include Insulin-like 3 (Insl3), a regulator of male fertility and testes descent, as well as the solute carriers Slc45a3 and Slc38a5, which are membrane transport proteins that may facilitate osmoregulation. Together, these results suggest that in male cactus mice, acute dehydration may be linked to reproductive modulation via Insl3, but not through gene expression differences in the subset of other a priori tested reproductive hormones. Although water availability is a reproductive cue in desert-rodents exposed to chronic drought, potential reproductive modification via Insl3 in response to acute water-limitation is a result which is unexpected in an animal capable of surviving and successfully reproducing year-round without available external water sources. Indeed, this work highlights the critical need for integrative research that examines every facet of organismal adaptation, particularly in light of global climate change, which is predicted, amongst other things, to increase climate variability, thereby exposing desert animals more frequently to the acute drought conditions explored here.\n",

      "Increasing evidence points to the importance of dendritic spines in the formation and allocation of memories, and alterations of spine number and physiology are associated to memory and cognitive disorders. Synaptic connections and pathways constitute the physical substrate that conveys information in the brain, and different combinations of active synaptic connections are believed to be responsible for the encoding of specific memories. In addition, modifications of the activity of such subsets of synapses are believed to be crucial for memory establishment, but a way to directly test this hypothesis, by selectively controlling the activity of potentiated spines, is currently lagging behind. Therefore it would be important to develop methods to tag active synapses for mapping functionally active connections and to selectively stimulate or interfere with active synapses. Here we introduce an approach to express light-sensitive membrane channels at synapses in an activity-dependent way by means of RNA and protein regulatory sequences. This approach is based on the local expression of reporter proteins, including optogenetic probes, at activated synapses and will allow the mapping of previously active synapses and the re-activation of the neuron only at these sites. This will allow extending the investigation of memory processes beyond the current neuron tagging technologies, whose resolution is limited at the cellular scale. Thus, it will be possible to unveil and recall the synaptic engram out of the global set of synapses.\n",

The addition of actin filaments reorganized membrane domains. We found that the process reached a steady state where line tension and lateral crowding balanced. Moreover, the phase boundary allowed myosin driven actin filament rearrangements to actively move individual lipid domains, often accompanied by their shape change, fusion or splitting. Our findings illustrate how actin cortex remodeling in cells may control dynamic rearrangements of lipids and other molecules inside domains without directly binding to actin filaments.\n",

      "Whether AMPA receptors (AMPARs) enter into neuronal synapses, by exocytosis from an internal pool, or by diffusion from an external membrane-bound pool, is hotly contested. 3D super-resolution fluorescent nanoscopy to measure the dynamics and placement of AMPAR is a powerful method for addressing this issue. However, probe size and accessibility to tightly packed spaces can be limiting. We have therefore labeled AMPARs with differently sized fluorophores: small organic fluorescent dyes (~ 4 nm), small quantum dots (sQD, ~10 nm in diameter), or big (commercial) quantum dots (bQD, ~ 20 nm in diameter). We then compared their diffusion rate, trajectories, and placement with respect to a postsynaptic density (PSD) protein, Homer 1c. Labeled with the small probes of sQDs or organic fluorophores, we find that AMPARs are located largely within PSDs (~73-93%), and generally reside in \\\"nanodomains\\\" with constrained diffusion. In contrast, when labeled with bQDs, only 5-10% of AMPARs are within PSDs. The results can be explained by relatively free access, or lack thereof, to synaptic clefts of the AMPARs when labeled with small or big probes, respectively. This implies that AMPARs primarily enter PSDs soon after their exocytosis and not from a large diffusive pool of extrasynaptic AMPARs.\n",

Hence, it is necessary to record from neuronal dendrites, which generate dendritic action potentials (DAP) and profoundly influence neural computation and plasticity. We measured neocortical sub- and supra-threshold dendritic membrane potential (DMP) from putative distal-most dendrites using tetrodes in freely behaving rats over multiple days with a high degree of stability and sub-millisecond temporal resolution. DAP firing rates were several fold larger than somatic rates. DAP rates were modulated by subthreshold DMP fluctuations which were far larger than DAP amplitude, indicting hybrid, analog-digital coding in the dendrites. Parietal DAP and DMP exhibited egocentric spatial maps comparable to pyramidal neurons. These results have important implications for neural coding and plasticity.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryMeasurement of cortical dendritic membrane potential for several days in freely behaving rats reveals disproportionate dendritic spiking and analog and digital coding.\n",
      "Morphogenetic processes demand the coordinated allocation of cells and tissues to their final destination in a spatio-temporal controlled way. Identifying how these morphogenetic movements are directed and implemented is essential for understanding morphogenesis. Topographical and scalar differences in adhesion and contractility within and between cells are essential, yet, the role that membrane remodeling may play remains less clear. To clarify how surface turnover and dynamics may modulate tissue arrangements we studied epiboly in the zebrafish. During epiboly the blastoderm expands as a result of an asymmetry of mechanical tension along the embryo surface. In this scenario, we found that the membrane removal by macropinocytosis of the external yolk cell syncytial layer (E-YSL) ahead of the blastoderm is key for epiboly progression In early zebrafish embryos, the activity of the GTPase Rab5ab was essential for endocytosis, and interference in its expression exclusively in the yolk cell resulted in the reduction of yolk cell actomyosin contractility, the disruption of cortical and internal yolk flows, a disequilibrium in force balance and as a result epiboly impairment. We conclude that regulated membrane remodeling is crucial for directing cell and tissue mechanics and coordinating morphogenetic movements during epiboly.\n",

      "The inward current flowing inside the post-synaptic terminal of a neuron modulates transiently the membrane voltage potential. Most of the excitatory connections are made on dendritic spines characterized by a large variability in their geometry.How the voltage in a spine is modulated by geometry remains elusive due in part to the absence of direct measurements. To understand the spine voltage-current relation, we develop here a model for the voltage and we use it to extract electrical properties from live cell imaging data. We first deconvolve the genetically encoded voltage sensor expressed in hippocampal neurons and then use electro-diffusion theory, to compute the electric field and the ionic flows induced in a dendritic spine.The ionic flow is driven by the electric field coupled to the charge densities that interact through the non-cylindrical spine geometry. We determine the I-V relation and conclude that the spine effective resistance is mostly determined by the neck geometry. This modulation of synaptic inputs by the spine neck is significantly larger than what was expected from traditional cable models. Thus modulating the postsynaptic current can be achieved by changing the number of receptors or by altering the spine geometry which independently affects the transformation of current into voltage.\\n\\nSignificance statementDendritic spines are geometrical structures receiving most of the excitatory transmission, yet how they modulate voltage from the synaptic current is not clear due to their submicron small size and specific non-cylindrical geometry. We study here the conversion of the synaptic current into voltage modulated by the spine geometry. Our approach is based on the electro-diffusion theory and we show that the spine neck is the main resistance filter, while the voltage is maintained constant in the head. Finally, we extract the effective resistance using a deconvolution of the genetically encoded voltage indicators expressed in hippocampal neurons. The present approach allows studying the electrical properties of many other structures such as glial small protrusions, cilia, and many others.\n",
      "The NALCN/NCA ion channel is a cation channel related to voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. NALCN has been reported to be a sodium leak channel with a conserved role in establishing neuronal resting membrane potential, but its precise cellular role and regulation are unclear. The Caenorhabditis elegans orthologs of NALCN, NCA-1 and NCA-2, act in premotor interneurons to regulate motor circuit activity that sustains locomotion. Recently we found that NCA-1 and NCA-2 are activated by a signal transduction pathway acting downstream of the heterotrimeric G protein Gq and the small GTPase Rho. Through a forward genetic screen, here we identify the GPCR kinase GRK-2 as a new player affecting signaling through the Gq-Rho-NCA pathway. Using structure-function analysis, we find that the GPCR phosphorylation and membrane association domains of GRK-2 are required for its function. Genetic epistasis experiments suggest that GRK-2 acts on the D2-like dopamine receptor DOP-3 to inhibit Go signaling and positively modulate NCA-1 and NCA-2 activity. Through cell-specific rescuing experiments, we find that GRK-2 and DOP-3 act in premotor interneurons to modulate NCA channel function. Finally, we demonstrate that dopamine, through DOP-3, negatively regulates NCA activity. Thus, this study identifies a pathway by which dopamine modulates the activity of the NCA channels.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDopamine is a neurotransmitter that acts in the brain by binding seven transmembrane receptors that are coupled to heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins). Neuronal G proteins often function by modulating ion channels that control membrane excitability. Here we identify a molecular cascade downstream of dopamine in the nematode C. elegans that involves activation of the dopamine receptor DOP-3, activation of the G protein GOA-1, and inactivation of the NCA-1 and NCA-2 ion channels. We also identify a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK-2) that inactivates the dopamine receptor DOP-3, thus leading to inactivation of GOA-1 and activation of the NCA channels. Thus, this study connects dopamine signaling to activity of the NCA channels through G protein signaling pathways.\n",
      "The NALCN/NCA ion channel is a cation channel related to voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels. NALCN has been reported to be a sodium leak channel with a conserved role in establishing neuronal resting membrane potential, but its precise cellular role and regulation are unclear. The Caenorhabditis elegans orthologs of NALCN, NCA-1 and NCA-2, act in premotor interneurons to regulate motor circuit activity that sustains locomotion. Recently we found that NCA-1 and NCA-2 are activated by a signal transduction pathway acting downstream of the heterotrimeric G protein Gq and the small GTPase Rho. Through a forward genetic screen, here we identify the GPCR kinase GRK-2 as a new player affecting signaling through the Gq-Rho-NCA pathway. Using structure-function analysis, we find that the GPCR phosphorylation and membrane association domains of GRK-2 are required for its function.

      "Cell-cell fusion is inherent to any form of sexual reproduction. Loss of HAPLESS 2/GENERATIVE CELL SPECIFIC 1 (HAP2/GCS1) proteins results in gamete fusion failure in different organisms but their exact role is unclear. Here we show that Arabidopsis HAP2/GCS1 expression in mammalian cells is sufficient to promote cell-cell fusion. Hemifusion and complete fusion depend on HAP2/GCS1 presence in both fusing cells. Furthermore, expression of HAP2 on the surface of pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus and on the target cells results in HAP2-dependent virus-cell fusion. This bilateral requirement can be bypassed by replacing the plant gene with C. elegans EFF-1 somatic cell fusogen in one of the fusing cells or the virus, indicating that HAP2/GCS1 and EFF-1 share a similar fusion mechanism. Structural modeling of the HAP2/GCS1 protein family predicts that they are homologous to EFF-1 and class II fusion proteins from enveloped viruses (e.g. dengue and Zika viruses). We name this superfamily FUSEXINS: FUSion proteins essential for sexual reproduction and EXoplasmic merger of plasma membranes. Thus, Fusexins unify the origin and evolution of sexual reproduction, enveloped virus entry into cells and somatic cell fusion.\n",
      "T cell signaling initiates upon binding of peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) on an antigen-presenting cell (APC) to the T cell receptor (TCR) on a T cell. TCR phosphorylation in response to pMHC binding is accompanied by segregation of the transmembrane phosphatase CD45 away from TCR-pMHC complexes. The kinetic segregation hypothesis proposes that CD45 exclusion shifts the local kinase-phosphatase balance to favor TCR phosphorylation. Spatial partitioning may arise from the size difference between the large CD45 extracellular domain and the smaller TCR-pMHC complex, although parsing potential contributions of extracellular protein size, actin activity, and lipid domains is difficult in living cells. Here, we reconstitute segregation of CD45 from bound receptor-ligand pairs using purified proteins on model membranes. Using a model receptor-ligand pair (FRB-FKBP), we first test physical and computational predictions for protein organization at membrane interfaces. We then show that the TCR-pMHC interaction causes partial exclusion of CD45. Comparing two developmentally-regulated isoforms of CD45, the larger RABC variant is excluded more rapidly and efficiently (~50%) than the smaller R0 isoform (~20%), suggesting that CD45 isotypes could regulate signaling thresholds in different T cell subtypes. Similar to the sensitivity of T cell signaling, TCR-pMHC interactions with Kds of [&le;]15 M were needed to exclude CD45. We further show that the co-receptor PD-1 with its ligand PD-L1, immunotherapy targets that inhibit T cell signaling, also exclude CD45. These results demonstrate that the binding energies of physiological receptor-ligand pairs on the T cell are sufficient to create spatial organization at membrane-membrane interfaces.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe interface between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell (APC) results in the formation of biochemically distinct plasma membrane domains that initiate signaling cascades.

In vitro, islets of Hv1-de[fi]cient and heterozygous mice, INS-1 (832/13) cells with siRNA-mediated knockdown of Hv1 exhibit a marked defect in glucose- and K+-induced insulin secretion.

Furthermore, loss of Hv1 increases insulin-containing granular pH and decreases cytosolic pH. In addition, histologic studies show a decrease in {beta} cell mass in islets of Hv1-deficient mice. Collectively, our results indicate that Hv1 supports insulin secretion in the {beta} cell by calcium entry, membrane depolarization and intracellular pH regulation.\n",

      "The expression of integral membrane proteins (IMPs) remains a major bottleneck in the characterization of this important protein class. IMP expression levels are currently unpredictable, which renders the pursuit of IMPs for structural and biophysical characterization challenging and inefficient. Experimental evidence demonstrates that changes within the nucleotide or amino-acid sequence for a given IMP can dramatically affect expression; yet these observations have not resulted in generalizable approaches to improved expression. Here, we develop a data-driven statistical predictor named IMProve, that, using only sequence information, increases the likelihood of selecting an IMP that expresses in E. coli. The IMProve model, trained on experimental data, combines a set of sequence-derived features resulting in an IMProve score, where higher values have a higher probability of success. The model is rigorously validated against a variety of independent datasets that contain a wide range of experimental outcomes from various IMP expression trials. The results demonstrate that use of the model can more than double the number of successfully expressed targets at any experimental scale. IMProve can immediately be used to identify favorable targets for characterization.\n",

      "GABAergic inhibition plays a critical role in the regulation of neuronal activity. In the neocortex, inhibitory interneurons that target the dendrites of pyramidal cells influence both electrical and biochemical postsynaptic signaling. Voltage-gated ion channels strongly shape dendritic excitability and the integration of excitatory inputs, but their contribution to GABAergic signaling is less well understood. By combining 2-photon calcium imaging and focal GABA uncaging, we show that voltage-gated potassium channels normally suppress the GABAergic inhibition of calcium signals evoked by back-propagating action potentials in dendritic spines and shafts of cortical pyramidal neurons. Moreover, the voltage-dependent inactivation of these channels leads to enhancement of dendritic calcium inhibition following somatic spiking. Computational modeling reveals that the enhancement of calcium inhibition involves an increase in action potential depolarization coupled with the nonlinear relationship between membrane voltage and calcium channel activation. Overall, our findings highlight the interaction between intrinsic and synaptic properties and reveal a novel mechanism for the activity-dependent scaling of GABAergic inhibition.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGABAergic inhibition potently regulates neuronal activity in the neocortex.

      "Tumor stroma remodeling is a key feature of malignant tumors and can promote cancer progression. Laminins are major constituents of basement membranes that physically separate the epithelium from the underlying stroma. By employing mouse models expressing high and low levels of the laminin 1 chain (LM1), we highlighted its implication in a tumorstroma crosstalk, thus leading to increased colon tumor incidence, angiogenesis and tumor growth. The underlying mechanism involves attraction of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts by LM1, VEGFA expression triggered by the complex integrin 2{beta}1-CXCR4 and binding of VEGFA to LM-111, which in turn promotes angiogenesis, tumor cell survival and proliferation. A gene signature comprising LAMA1, ITGB1, ITGA2, CXCR4 and VEGFA has negative predictive value in colon cancer. Together, this information opens novel opportunities for diagnosis and anti-cancer targeting.\n",
      "The defining feature of the mycobacterial outer membrane (OM) is the presence of mycolic acids (MAs), which in part render the bilayer extremely hydrophobic and impermeable to external insults, including many antibiotics. While the biosynthetic pathway of MAs is well studied, the mechanism(s) by which these lipids are transported across the cell envelope is(are) much less known. MmpL3, an essential inner membrane (IM) protein, is implicated in MA transport, but its exact function has not been elucidated. It is believed to be the cellular target of several anti-mycobacterial compounds; however, evidence for direct inhibition of MmpL3 activity is also lacking. Here, we establish that MmpL3 is the MA flippase at the IM of mycobacteria, and is the molecular target of BM212, a 1,5-diarylpyrrole compound. We develop assays that selectively access mycolates on the surface of Mycobacterium smegmatis spheroplasts, allowing us to monitor flipping of MAs across the IM. Using these assays, we establish the mechanism-of-action of BM212 as a potent MmpL3 inhibitor, and employ it as a molecular probe to demonstrate the requirement for functional MmpL3 in the transport of MAs across the IM. Finally, we show that BM212 binds MmpL3 directly and inhibits its activity. Our work provides fundamental insights into OM biogenesis and MA transport in mycobacteria. Furthermore, our assays serve as an important platform for accelerating the validation of small molecules that target MmpL3, and their development as future anti-tuberculosis drugs.\n",

      "The process of proteolysis is a factor involved in control of the proper development of the plant and its responses to a changeable environment. Recent research has shown that proteases are not only engaged in quality control and protein turnover processes but also participate in the process which is known as regulated membrane proteolysis (RIP). Four families of integral membrane proteases, belonging to three different classes, have been identified: serine intramembrane proteases known as rhomboid proteases, site-2 proteases belonging to zinc metalloproteases, and two families of aspartic proteases: presenilins and signal peptide peptidases. The studies concerning intramembrane proteases in higher plants are, however, focused on Arabidopsis thaliana. The aim of the study was to identify and retrieve protein sequences of intramembrane protease homologs from other higher plant species and perform a detailed analysis of their primary sequences as well as their phylogenetic relations. This approach allows us to indicate several previously undescribed issues which may provide important directions for further research.\n",
      "AbstractRecent data have expanded our understanding of Notch signaling by identifying a C2 domain at the N-terminus of Notch ligands which has both lipid- and receptor-binding properties. We present novel structures of human ligands Jagged2 and DLL4 and human Notch-2, together with functional assays, which suggest that ligand-mediated coupling of membrane recognition and Notch binding is likely to be critical in establishing the optimal context for Notch signaling. Comparisons between the Jagged and Delta family show a huge diversity in the structures of the loops at the apex of the C2 domain implicated in membrane recognition and Jagged1 missense mutations which affect these loops and are associated with extrahepatic biliary atresia lead to a loss of membrane recognition, but do not alter Notch binding. Taken together, these data suggest that C2 domain binding to membranes is an important element in tuning ligand-dependent Notch signaling in different physiological contexts.\n",
      "Sensory neurons capture information from the environment and convert it into signals that can greatly impact the survival of an organism. These systems are thus under heavy selective pressure, including for the most efficient use of energy to support their sensitivity and efficiency1. In this regard, the vertebrate photoreceptor cells face a dual challenge. They not only need to preserve their membrane excitability via ion pumps by ATP hydrolysis2 but also maintain a highly membrane rich organelle, the outer segment, which is the primary site of phototransduction, creating a considerable biosynthetic demand. How photoreceptors manage carbon allocation to balance their catabolic and anabolic demands is poorly understood. One metabolic feature of the retina is its ability to convert the majority of its glucose into lactate3,4 even in the presence of oxygen. This phenomenon, aerobic glycolysis, is found in cancer and proliferating cells, and is thought to promote biomass buildup to sustain proliferation5,6. The purpose of aerobic glycolysis in the retina, its relevance to photoreceptor physiology, and its regulation, are not understood. Here, we show that rod photoreceptors rely on glycolysis for their outer segment (OS) biogenesis. Genetic perturbations targeting allostery or key regulatory nodes in the glycolytic pathway impacted the OS size. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling was found to regulate glycolysis, with antagonism of this pathway resulting in anabolic deficits. These data demonstrate the cell autonomous role of the glycolytic pathway in OS maintenance and provide evidence that aerobic glycolysis is part of a metabolic program that supports the biosynthetic needs of a normal neuronal cell type.\n",

      "Diacylglycerol (DAG) is a lipid second messenger produced by receptor stimulated phospholipase C and is capable of activating several PKC isoforms. Classical PKC isoforms require simultaneous presence of calcium and DAG for activation and relocation to membranes. The aim of this study was to synthesize a photolabile precursor of DAG and examine the effect of an immediate increase of the signaling lipid on PKC relocation. Caged DAG was synthesized using a photoreleasable 7-diethyl-aminocoumarin (DEACM) group. Photolysis was monitored in vitro by an increase in coumarin fluorescence from which an uncaging quantum yield of 1.1% was determined. This quantum yield proved ideal for efficient uncaging at high UV power while allowing localization of the fluorescent compound at low UV power. Taking advantage of the coumarin fluorescence, it was demonstrated that DEACM-DiC8 accumulated inside cells. Effects of DAG photorelease on periodic relocations of PKCbetaII, induced by histamine, UTP or EGF, were studied. Photorelease of DAG in cyto immediately increased the amplitude and duration of relocation events, regardless of the agonist used. Together, the results demonstrate the usefulness of caged DAG for dissecting PKC signaling and suggest that DAG levels are limiting during signaling.\n",

      "AbstractZinc is a micronutrient required for symbiotic nitrogen fixation. It has been proposed that in model legume Medicago truncatula, zinc is delivered in a similar fashion as iron, i.e. by the root vasculature into the nodule and released in the infection/differentiation zone. There, zinc transporters must introduce this element into rhizobia-infected cells to metallate the apoproteins that use zinc as a cofactor. MtZIP6 (Medtr4g083570) is a M. truncatula Zinc-Iron Permease (ZIP) that is expressed only in roots and nodules, with the highest expression levels in the infection/differentiation zone. Immunolocalization studies indicate that it is located in the plasma membrane of rhizobia-infected cells in the nodule. Down-regulating MtZIP6 expression levels with RNAi does not result in any strong phenotype when plants are being watered with mineral nitrogen. However, these silenced plants displayed severe growth defects when they depended on nitrogen fixed by their nodules, as a consequence of the loss of 80% of their nitrogenase activity. The reduction of this activity was not the result of iron not reaching the nodule, but an indirect effect of zinc being retained in the infection/differentiation zone and not reaching the cytosol of rhizobia-infected cells. These data are consistent with a model in which MtZIP6 would be responsible for zinc uptake by rhizobia-infected nodule cells in the infection/differentiation zone.\n",
      "Mitochondrial transplantation is currently being explored as a means to repair and restore proper organelle function in a variety of inherited and acquired disorders of energy metabolism. The optimal preparation and application of donor mitochondria is unknown, but most studies in vivo have used injection techniques or, for tissue studies, unpackaged mitochondria (organelles isolated and suspended in buffer) in transplant experiments. Packaging in lipid rafts can increase recipient cell uptake of some compounds and objects. We present the first data comparing recipient cell uptake of unpackaged mitochondria to recipient cell uptake of mitochondria packaged in cell membrane lipids. Mitochondria and membranes were prepared from autologous cells and applied to cells (fibroblasts) in culture. Both unpackaged and lipid-packaged mitochondria were taken into recipient cells and the donor mitochondria showed evidence, in each case, of retained functionality and the ability to merge with the recipient mitochondrial matrix. However, lipid packaging appeared to enhance the uptake of functional mitochondria. Current studies of mitochondrial transplantation in animal models might fruitfully explore the utility and efficacy of lipid-packaged mitochondria in transplant experiments.\n",

The measured values scatter over an order of magnitude but the corresponding Arrhenius activation energies converge in the current literature. Osmotic flux through an AQP was simulated as water current forced through the channel by kilobar hydraulic pressure or theoretically approximated as single-file diffusion. In this paper, we report large scale simulations of osmotic current under sub M gradient through three water channels (the water-specific AQP4 and AQP5 along with aquaglyceroporin GlpF) using the mature particle mesh Ewald technique (PME) for which the established force fields have been optimized with known accuracy. These simulations were implemented with hybrid periodic boundary conditions devised to avoid the artifactitious mixing across the membrane in a regular PME simulation. The computed single-channel permeabilities at 5{degrees}C and 25{degrees}C are in agreement with recently refined experiments on GlpF. The Arrhenius activation energies extracted from our simulations for all the three AQPs agree with the in vitro measurements. The single-file diffusion approximations from our large-scale simulations are consistent with the current literature on smaller systems. From these unambiguous agreements among the in vitro and in silico studies, we observe the quantitative accuracy of the all-atom force fields of the current literature for water-channel biology. We also observe that AQP4, that is particularly rich in the central nervous system, is more efficient in water conduction and more temperature-sensitive than other water-specific channel proteins.\n",
      "AbstractBacterial nanowires have garnered recent interest as a proposed Extracellular Electron Transfer (EET) pathway that links the bacterial electron transport chain to solid-phase electron acceptors away from the cell. In vivo fluorescence Light Microscopy (fLM) imaging recently showed that Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 nanowires are extensions of the outer membrane that contain EET components. However, their fine structure and distribution of cytochrome electron carriers remained unclear, making it difficult to evaluate the electron transport mechanism along the nanowires. Here, we report high-resolution images of nanowires using Electron Cryo-Tomography (ECT). We developed a robust method for fLM imaging of nanowire growth on electron microscopy grids and used correlative light and electron microscopy to identify and image the same nanowires by ECT. Our results confirm that S. oneidensis nanowires are outer membrane extensions, and further reveal that nanowires are dynamic chains of interconnected Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs) with variable dimensions, curvature, and extent of tubulation. Junction densities that potentially stabilize OMV chains are seen between neighboring vesicles in cryotomograms. Our ECT results also provide the first hints of the positions and packing of periplasmic and outer membrane proteins consistent with cytochromes. We observe tight packing of putative cytochromes along lateral patches that extend tens of nanometers, but not across the micrometer scale of whole nanowires. We therefore propose that electron transfer along nanowires involves a combination of direct hopping and diffusive events that link neighboring redox proteins.\n",
      "To establish a productive infection in host cells, viruses often use one or multiple host membrane glycoprotein as their receptors. For Influenza A virus (IAV) such a glycoprotein receptor has not been described, to date. Here we show that IAV is using the host membrane glycoprotein CD66c as a receptor for entry into human epithelial lung cells. Neuraminidase (NA), a viral spike protein binds to CD66c on the cell surface during IAV entry into the host cells. Lung cells overexpressing CD66c showed an increase in virus binding and subsequent entry into the cell. Upon comparison, CD66c demonstrated higher binding capacity than other membrane glycoproteins (EGFR and DC-SIGN) reported earlier to facilitate IAV entry into host cells. siRNA mediated knockdown of CD66c from lung cells inhibited virus binding on cell surface and entry into cells. Blocking CD66c by antibody on the cell surface resulted in decreased virus entry. We found CD66c is a specific glycoprotein receptor for influenza A virus that did not affect entry of non-IAV RNA virus (Hepatitis C virus). Finally, IAV pre-incubated with recombinant CD66c protein when administered intranasally in mice showed decreased cytopathic effects in mice lungs. This publication is the first to report CD66c (CEACAM6) as a glycoprotein receptor for Influenza A virus.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCells are enclosed by a semipermeable membrane that allows selective exchange of biomolecules between cells and their surroundings. A set of specialized proteins in this semipermeable membrane, work like gatekeepers to the cell and regulate entry of these biomolecules. One class of such surface proteins is termed as receptors. Viruses bind to one or more of these receptors and manipulate gatekeepers for their own successful entry into host-cells. A membrane protein that influenza A virus (Flu virus) uses for entry into the cells was not discovered till date. This study reports for the first time, a receptor for influenza A virus, that was sought after by researchers for decades. The viral receptor is a promising target that can be used to inhibit virus entry into host cells.\n",
      "The production of antimicrobial reactive oxygen species by the nicotinamide dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase complex is an important mechanism for control of invading pathogens. Herein, we show that the gastrointestinal pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus counteracts reactive oxygen species (ROS) production using the Type III Secretion System 2 (T3SS2) effector VopL. In the absence of VopL, intracellular V. parahaemolyticus undergo ROS-dependent filamentation, with concurrent limited growth. During infection, VopL assembles actin into non-functional filaments resulting in a dysfunctional actin cytoskeleton that can no longer mediate the assembly of the NADPH oxidase at the cell membrane, thereby limiting ROS production. This is the first example of how a T3SS2 effector contributes to the intracellular survival of V. parahaemolyticus to support the establishment of a protective intracellular replicative niche.\n",
      "Filamentous plant pathogens and symbionts invade their host cells but remain enveloped by host-derived membranes. The mechanisms underlying the biogenesis and functions of these host-microbe interfaces are poorly understood. Recently, we showed that PexRD54, an effector from the Irish potato famine pathogen Phytophthora infestans, binds host protein ATG8CL to stimulate autophagosome formation and deplete the selective autophagy receptor Joka2 from ATG8CL complexes. Here, we show that during P. infestans infection, ATG8CL autophagosomes are diverted to the pathogen interface. Our findings are consistent with the view that the pathogen coopts host selective autophagy for its own benefit.\n",
      "Cell-free transcription-translation platforms have been widely utilized to express soluble proteins in basic synthetic biological circuit prototyping. From a synthetic biology point of view, it is critical to express membrane proteins in cell-free transcription-translation systems, and use them directly in biocircuits, considering the fact that histidine kinases, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and other important biosensors are all membrane proteins. Previous studies have expressed membrane proteins in cell-free systems with the help of detergents, liposomes or nanodiscs, but have not demonstrated the ability to prototype circuit behavior for the purpose of testing more complex circuit functions involving membrane-bound proteins. Built on previous efforts, in this work we demonstrated that we could co-translationally express solubilized and active membrane proteins in our cell-free TX-TL platform with membrane-like materials. We first tested the expression of several constructs with {beta}1 and {beta}2 adrenergic receptors in TX-TL and observed significant insoluble membrane protein production. The addition of nanodiscs to the cell free expression system enabled solubilization of membrane proteins. Nanodisc is lipoprotein-based membrane-like material. The activity of {beta}2 adrenergic receptor was tested with both fluorescence and Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) binding assays by monitoring the specific binding response of small-molecule binders, carazolol and norepinephrine. Our results suggest that it is promising to use cell-free expression systems to prototype synthetic biocircuits involving single chain membrane proteins without extra procedures. This data made us one step closer to testing complex membrane protein circuits in cell-free environment.\n",

Loss of MtCOPT1 function results in a copper-mitigated reduction of biomass production when the plant obtains its nitrogen exclusively from symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Mutation of MtCOPT1 results in diminished nitrogenase activity in nodules, likely an indirect effect from the loss of a copper-dependent function, such as cytochrome oxidase activity in copt1-1 bacteroids.\\n\\n* These data are consistent with a model in which MtCOPT1 transports copper from the apoplast into nodule cells to provide copper for essential metabolic processes associated with symbiotic nitrogen fixation.\n",

      "Dense-core vesicles (DCVs) are secretory organelles that store and release modulatory neurotransmitters from neurons and endocrine cells. Recently, the conserved coiled-coil protein CCCP-1 was identified as a component of the DCV biogenesis pathway in the nematode C. elegans. CCCP-1 binds the small GTPase RAB-2 and colocalizes with it at the trans-Golgi. Here we report a structure-function analysis of CCCP-1 to identify domains of the protein important for its localization, binding to RAB-2, and function in DCV biogenesis. We find that the CCCP-1 C-terminal domain (CC3) has multiple activities. CC3 is necessary and sufficient for CCCP-1 localization and for binding to RAB-2, and is required for the function of CCCP-1 in DCV biogenesis. Additionally, CCCP-1 binds membranes directly through its CC3 domain, indicating that CC3 may comprise a previously uncharacterized lipid-binding motif. We conclude that CCCP-1 is a coiled-coil protein that binds an activated Rab and localizes to the Golgi via its C-terminus, properties similar to members of the golgin family of proteins.

      "In budding yeast, cell cycle progression and ribosome biogenesis are dependent upon plasma membrane growth, which ensures that events of cell growth are coordinated with each other and with the cell cycle. However, the signals that link the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis to membrane growth are poorly understood. Here, we used proteome-wide mass spectrometry to systematically discover signals associated with membrane growth. The results suggest that membrane trafficking events required for membrane growth generate sphingolipid-dependent signals. A conserved signaling network plays an essential role in signaling by responding to delivery of sphingolipids to the plasma membrane. In addition, sphingolipid-dependent signals control phosphorylation of protein kinase C (Pkc1), which plays an essential role in the pathways that link the cell cycle and ribosome biogenesis to membrane growth. Together, these discoveries provide new clues to how growth-dependent signals control cell growth and the cell cycle.\n",

      "Myelin around axons is currently widely studied by structural analyses and large scale imaging techniques, with the goal to decipher its critical role in neuronal protection. While there is strong evidence that in myelin, lipid composition and lipid membrane morphology are affected during the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, there is no quantitative method yet to report its ultrastructure in tissues at both molecular and macroscopic levels, in conditions potentially compatible with in vivo observations. In this work, we study and quantify molecular order of lipids in myelin at sub-diffraction scales, using label-free polarization resolved Coherent Anti Stokes Raman (PR-CARS), which exploits CARS sensitivity to coupling between light polarization and oriented molecular vibrational bonds. Importantly, the method does not use any a priori parameters in the sample such as lipid type, orientational organization and composition. We show that lipid molecular order of myelin in the mouse spinal cord is significantly reduced throughout the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis, even in myelin regions that appear morphologically unaffected. This technique permits to unravel molecular-scale perturbations of lipid layers at early stage of the demyelination progression, while the membrane architecture at the mesoscopic scale (here about 100 nm) seems much less affected. Such information cannot be brought by pure morphological observation and opens new prospectives towards molecular-scale understanding of neurodegenerative diseases.\n",
      "Na+/K+-ATPase transports Na+ and K+ ions across the cell membrane via an ion binding site made alternatively accessible to the intra- and extracellular milieu by conformational transitions that confer marked changes in ion binding stoichiometry and selectivity. To probe the mechanism of these changes, we used molecular simulation approaches to identify the protonation state of Na+ and K+ coordinating residues in E1P and E2P conformations. Further analysis of these simulations revealed a novel molecular mechanism responsible for the change in protonation state: the conformation-dependent binding of an anion (a chloride ion in our simulations) to a previously unrecognized cytoplasmic site in the loop between transmembrane helices 8 and 9, which influences the electrostatic potential of the crucial Na+-coordinating residue D926. This mechanistic model is consistent with experimental observations and provides a molecular-level picture of how E1P to E2P enzyme conformational transitions are coupled to changes in ion binding stoichiometry and selectivity.\n",
      "Over the past decade, the Rosetta biomolecular modeling suite has informed diverse biological questions and engineering challenges ranging from interpretation of low-resolution structural data to design of nanomaterials, protein therapeutics, and vaccines. Central to Rosettas success is the energy function: amodel parameterized from small molecule and X-ray crystal structure data used to approximate the energy associated with each biomolecule conformation. This paper describes the mathematical models and physical concepts that underlie the latest Rosetta energy function, beta_nov15. Applying these concepts,we explain how to use Rosetta energies to identify and analyze the features of biomolecular models.Finally, we discuss the latest advances in the energy function that extend capabilities from soluble proteins to also include membrane proteins, peptides containing non-canonical amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and other macromolecules.\n",
      "Many cellular activities involving cell membrane manifest through changes in membrane capacitance. The accuracy and precision of cell membrane capacitance measurement is limited by the measuring system, which distorts membrane current responses used for analysis of impedance parameters. We developed a practical deconvolution procedure for reconstruction of the time course of membrane current and applied it to current responses recorded at step voltage changes by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. In contrast to the recorded current responses, the reconstructed current responses could be exactly described by adequate impedance models of the recorded circuit. Deconvolution of membrane currents improved the performance of the square-wave method of high-resolution membrane capacitance recording by providing higher accuracy in a wider range of cell sizes and by eliminating cross-talk errors in parameter estimates. This allowed resolving instabilities in the recording conditions arising from parasitic capacitance and seal resistance variation. Complex tests on hardware models, on simulated data sets, and on living cells confirmed reliability of the deconvolution method for membrane capacitance recording. The aptitude of the method was demonstrated in isolated cardiac myocytes by recording spontaneous vesicular events, by discerning formation of a fusion pore, and by revealing artefacts due to unstable seal resistance.\n",
      "Investigating the role of protein localization is crucial to understand protein function in cells or tissues. However, in many cases the role of different subcellular fractions of given proteins along the apical-basal axis of polarized cells has not been investigated in vivo, partially due to lack of suitable tools. Here, we present the GrabFP system, a nanobody-based toolbox to modify the localization and the dispersal of GFP-tagged proteins along the apical-basal axis of polarized cells. We show that the GrabFP system is an effective and easy-to-implement tool to mislocalize cytosolic and transmembrane GFP-tagged proteins and thereby functionally investigate protein localization along the apical-basal axis. We use the GrabFP system as a tool to study the extracellular dispersal of the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) protein and show that the Dpp gradient forming in the lateral plane of the Drosophila wing disc epithelium is essential for patterning of the wing imaginal disc.\n",
      "CTLA4 is an essential negative regulator of T cell immune responses and is a key checkpoint regulating autoimmunity and anti-tumour immunity. Genetic mutations resulting in a quantitative defect in CTLA4 are associated with the development of an immune dysregulation syndrome. Endocytosis of CTLA4 is rapid and continuous with subsequent degradation or recycling. CTLA4 has two natural ligands, the surface transmembrane proteins CD80 and CD86 that are shared with the T cell co-stimulatory receptor CD28. Upon ligation with CD80/CD86, CTLA4 can remove these ligands from the opposing cells by transendocytosis. The efficiency of ligand removal is thought to be highly dependent on the processes involved in CTLA4 trafficking. With a combined in vitro-in silico study, we quantify the rates of CTLA4 internalization, recycling and degradation. We incorporate experimental data from cell lines and primary human T cells. Our model provides a framework for exploring the impact of altered affinity of natural ligands or therapeutic anti-CTLA4 antibodies and for predicting the effect of clinically relevant CTLA4 pathway mutations. The presented methodology for extracting trafficking rates can be transferred to the study of other transmembrane proteins.\n",
      "The lateral organization of molecules in the cellular plasma membrane plays an important role in cellular signaling. A critical parameter for membrane molecular organization is how the membrane lipids are packed (or ordered). Polarity sensitive dyes are powerful tools to characterize such lipid membrane order, employing for example confocal and two-photon microscopy. The investigation of potential lipid nanodomains, however, requires the use of super resolution microscopy. Here, we test the performance of the polarity sensitive membrane dyes Di-4-ANEPPDHQ, Di-4-AN(F)EPPTEA and NR12S in super resolution STED microscopy. Measurements on cell-derived membrane vesicles, in the plasma membrane of live cells, and on single virus particles show the high potential of these dyes for probing nanoscale membrane heterogeneity.\n",

      "The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a versatile molecular weapon used by many bacteria against eukaryotic hosts or prokaryotic competitors. It consists of a cytoplasmic bacteriophage tail-like structure anchored in the bacterial cell envelope via a cytoplasmic baseplate and a periplasmic membrane complex. Rapid contraction of the sheath in the bacteriophage tail-like structure propels an inner tube/spike complex through the target cell envelope to deliver effectors. While structures of purified contracted sheath and purified membrane complex have been solved, because sheaths contract upon cell lysis and purification, no structure is available for the extended sheath. Structural information about the baseplate is also lacking. Here we use electron cryotomography to directly visualize intact T6SS structures inside Myxococcus xanthus cells. Using sub-tomogram averaging, we resolve the structure of the extended sheath and membrane-associated components including the baseplate. Moreover, we identify novel extracellular bacteriophage tail fiber-like antennae. These results provide new structural insights into how the extended sheath prevents premature disassembly and how this sophisticated machine may recognize targets.\n",

Owing to the emergence and increase of multi drug resistance to various conventional drugs, and the continuing importance on health-care expenditure, many researchers have focused to develop novel and effective anticancer compounds. In the present study, a series of in-house synthesized quinazoline and quinazolino-benzothiadiazine derivatives were investigated for their anticancer efficacy against a panel of five cancer (DU145, MCF7, HepG2, SKOV3 and MDA-MB-231) and one normal (MRC5) cell lines. Among all the tested compounds, fifteen of them exhibited promising growth-inhibitory effect (0.15 - 5.0 M) and induced cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. In addition, the selected compounds inhibited the microtubule assembly; altered mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced the levels of caspase-9 in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the active compound with combination of drugs showed synergistic effect at lower concentrations and the drug uptake was mediated through clathrin mediated endocytic pathway. Our results indicated that quinazoline and quinazolino-benzothiadiazine conjugates could serve as potential leads in the development of personalized cancer therapeutics.\\n\\nSummaryThe present study describes the exploration of small molecules based on heterocyclic scaffolds for tubulin target based development of anticancer agents.\n",
      "Notch signaling plays an essential role in the proliferation, differentiation and cell fate determination of various tissues, including the developing pancreas. One regulator of the Notch pathway is GDE2 (or GDPD5), a transmembrane ecto-phosphodiesterase that cleaves GPI-anchored proteins at the plasma membrane, including a Notch ligand regulator. Here we report that Gde2 knockdown in zebrafish embryos leads to developmental defects, particularly, impaired motility and reduced pancreas differentiation, as shown by decreased expression of insulin and other pancreatic markers. Exogenous expression of human GDE2, but not catalytically dead GDE2, similarly leads to developmental defects. These data reveal functional conservation between zebrafish and human GDE2, and suggest that strict regulation of GDE2 expression and catalytic activity is critical for correct embryonic patterning. In particular, our data uncover a role for GDE2 in regulating pancreas differentiation.\n",
      "Notch signaling plays an essential role in the proliferation, differentiation and cell fate determination of various tissues, including the developing pancreas. One regulator of the Notch pathway is GDE2 (or GDPD5), a transmembrane ecto-phosphodiesterase that cleaves GPI-anchored proteins at the plasma membrane, including a Notch ligand regulator. Here we report that Gde2 knockdown in zebrafish embryos leads to developmental defects, particularly, impaired motility and reduced pancreas differentiation, as shown by decreased expression of insulin and other pancreatic markers.

      "The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and related apicomplexan pathogens contain an essential plastid organelle, the apicoplast, which is a key anti-parasitic target. Derived from secondary endosymbiosis, the apicoplast depends on novel, but largely cryptic, mechanisms for protein/lipid import and organelle inheritance during parasite replication. These critical biogenesis pathways present untapped opportunities to discover new parasite-specific drug targets. We used an innovative screen to identify actinonin as having a novel mechanism-of-action inhibiting apicoplast biogenesis. Resistant mutation, chemical-genetic interaction, and biochemical inhibition demonstrate that the unexpected target of actinonin in P. falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii is FtsH1, a homolog of a bacterial membrane AAA+ metalloprotease. Pf FtsH1 is the first novel factor required for apicoplast biogenesis identified in a phenotypic screen. Our findings demonstrate that FtsH1 is a novel and, importantly, druggable antimalarial target. Development of FtsH1 inhibitors will have significant advantages with improved drug kinetics and multistage efficacy against multiple human parasites.\n",

      "Cellular protein levels are dictated by the balance between gene transcription, mRNA translation and protein degradation, among other factors. Cells must manage their proteomes during stress; one way in which they may do so, in principle, is by differential translation. We used ribosome profiling to directly monitor translation in E. coli at 30 {degrees}C and investigate how this changes after 10-20 minutes of heat shock at 42 {degrees}C. Translation is controlled by the interplay of several RNA hybridization processes, which are expected to be temperature sensitive. However, translation efficiencies are robustly maintained after thermal heat shock and after mimicking the heat shock response transcriptional program at 30 {degrees}C. Several gene-specific parameters correlated with translation efficiency, including predicted mRNA structure and whether a gene is cotranslationally translocated into the inner membrane. Genome-wide predictions of the temperature dependence of mRNA structure suggest that relatively few genes show a melting transition between 30 {degrees}C and 42 {degrees}C, consistent with our observations. A linear model with five parameters can predict 33% of the variation in translation efficiency between genes, which may be useful in interpreting transcriptome data.\n",
      "Cyanobacteria are among the most abundant photosynthetic organisms in the oceans; viruses infecting cyanobacteria (cyanophages) can alter cyanobacterial populations, and therefore affect the local food web and global biochemical cycles. These phages carry auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs), which rewire various metabolic pathways in the infected host cell, resulting in increased phage fitness. Coping with stress resulting from photodamage appears to be a central necessity of cyanophages, yet the overall mechanism is poorly understood. Here we report a novel, widespread cyanophage AMG, encoding a fatty acid desaturase (FAD), found in two genotypes with distinct geographical distribution. FADs are capable of modulating the fluidity of the hosts membrane, a fundamental stress response in living cells. We show that both viral fatty acid desaturases (vFADs) families are {Delta}9 lipid desaturases, catalyzing the desaturation at carbon 9 in C16 fatty acid chains. In addition, we present the first fatty acid profiling for marine cyanobacteria, which suggests a unique desaturation pathway of medium to long chain fatty acids no longer than C16, in accordance to the vFADs activity. Our findings suggest that cyanophages fiddle with the infected hosts cell, leading to increased photoprotection and potentially enhancing viral-encoded photosynthetic proteins, resulting in a new viral metabolic network.\n",
      "The MinD and MinE proteins of Escherichia coli self-organize into a standing-wave oscillator on the membrane to help align division at mid-cell. When unleashed from cellular confines, we find that MinD and MinE form a wide spectrum of patterns on artificial bilayers - static amoebas, traveling waves, traveling mushrooms, and bursts with standing-wave dynamics. We recently focused our cell-free studies on bursts because their dynamics closely resemble those found in vivo. The data unveiled a patterning mechanism largely governed by MinE regulation of MinD interaction with membrane. We proposed that the MinD to MinE ratio on the membrane acts as a toggle switch between MinE-stimulated recruitment or release of MinD from the membrane. Here we provide data that further refines and extends our model that explains the remarkable spectrum of patterns supported by these two  simple proteins.\n",
      "Biogenesis of the outer membrane (OM) in Gram-negative bacteria, which is essential for viability, requires the coordinated transport and assembly of proteins and lipids, including lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and phospholipids (PLs), into the membrane. While pathways for LPS and OM protein assembly are well-studied, how PLs are transported to and from the OM is not clear. Mechanisms that ensure OM stability and homeostasis are also unknown. The trans-envelope Tol-Pal complex, whose physiological role has remained elusive, is important for OM stability. Here, we establish that the Tol-Pal complex is required for PL transport and OM lipid homeostasis in Escherichia coli. Cells lacking the complex exhibit defects in lipid asymmetry and accumulate excess phospholipids (PLs) in the OM. This imbalance in OM lipids is due to defective retrograde PL transport in the absence of a functional Tol-Pal complex. Thus, cells ensure the assembly of a stable OM by maintaining an excess flux of PLs to the OM only to return the surplus to the inner membrane. Our findings also provide insights into the mechanism by which the Tol-Pal complex may promote OM invagination during cell division.\n",

Coverage of genetic variants was increased compared to previous studies by adding exome genotypes to previously available genome-wide data and using the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel for imputation. Standard quality control was applied. Phenotypes were symptom improvement and remission after 12 weeks of antidepressant treatment. NEWMEDS consortium samples and Pharmacogenomic Research Network Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomic Study (PGRN-AMPS) served for replication.\\n\\n7,062,950 SNPs were analysed in GENDEP (n=738) and STAR*D (n=1409). rs116692768 (p=1.80e-08, ITGA9 (integrin alpha 9)) and rs76191705 (p=2.59e-08, NRXN3 (neurexin 3)) were significantly associated with symptom improvement during citalopram/escitalopram treatment.

      "Non-membrane-bound organelles that behave like liquid droplets are widespread among eukaryotic cells. Their dysregulation appears to be a critical step in several neurodegenerative conditions. Here we report that tau protein, the primary constituent of Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles, can form liquid droplets and therefore has the necessary biophysical properties to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in cells. Consonant with the factors that induce LLPS, tau is an intrinsically disordered protein that complexes with RNA to form droplets. Uniquely, the pool of RNAs to which tau binds in living cells are tRNAs. This phase state of tau is held in an approximately 1:1 charge balance across the protein and the nucleic acid constituents, and can thus be maximal at different RNA:tau mass ratios depending on the biopolymer constituents involved. This feature is characteristic of complex coacervation. We furthermore show that the LLPS process is directly and sensitively tuned by salt concentration and temperature, implying it is modulated by both electrostatic interactions between the involved protein and nucleic acid constituents, as well as net changes in entropy. Despite the high protein concentration within the complex coacervate phase, tau is locally freely tumbling and capable of diffusing through the droplet interior. In fact, tau in the condensed phase state does not reveal any immediate changes in local protein packing, local conformations and local protein dynamics from that of tau in the dilute solution state. In contrast, the population of aggregation-prone tau as induced by the complexation with heparin is accompanied by large changes in local tau conformations and irreversible aggregation. However, prolonged residency within the droplet state eventually results in the emergence of detectable {beta}-sheet structures according to thioflavin-T assay. These findings suggest that the droplet state can incubate tau and pre-dispose the protein toward the formation of insoluble fibrils.\n",

      "Some natural clays and synthetic nanofibres present in the environment have a severe impact on human health. After several decades of research, the molecular mechanism of how asbestos induce cancers is not well understood. Different fibres, including asbestos, can penetrate the membrane and introduce DNA in both, bacterial and eukaryotic cells. Incubating Escherichia coli with sepiolite, a clayey material, and asbestos under friction forces, both fibres cause double-strand breaks in bacteria. Since antibiotics and clays are used together in animal husbandry, the mutagenic effect of these fibres might constitute a pathway to antibiotic resistance due to the friction provided by peristalsis of the gut from farm animals in addition to the previously proposed horizontal gene transfer. Moreover, we raise the possibility that the same mechanism could generate bacteria diversity in natural scenarios with a role in the evolution of species. Finally, we provide a new model on how asbestos may promote mutagenesis and cancer based on the observed mechanical genotoxicity.\n",

      "During the generation and evolution of the eukaryotic cell, a proteobacterial endosymbiont was refashioned into the mitochondrion, an organelle that appears to have been present in the ancestor of all present-day eukaryotes. Mitochondria harbor proteomes derived from coding information located both inside and outside the organelle, and the rate-limiting step toward the formation of eukaryotic cells may have been development of an import apparatus allowing protein entry to mitochondria. Currently, a widely conserved translocon allows proteins to pass from the cytosol into mitochondria, but how proteins encoded outside of mitochondria were first directed to these organelles at the dawn of eukaryogenesis is not clear. Because several proteins targeted by a carboxyl-terminal tail anchor (TA) appear to have the ability to insert spontaneously into the mitochondrial outer membrane (OM), it is possible that self-inserting, tail-anchored polypeptides obtained from bacteria might have formed the first gate allowing proteins to access mitochondria from the cytosol. Here, we tested whether bacterial TAs are capable of targeting to mitochondria. In a survey of proteins encoded by the proteobacterium Escherichia coli, predicted TA sequences were directed to specific subcellular locations within the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Importantly, TAs obtained from DUF883 family members ElaB and YqjD were abundantly localized to and inserted at the mitochondrial OM. Our results support the notion that eukaryotic cells are able to utilize membrane-targeting signals present in bacterial proteins obtained by lateral gene transfer, and our findings make plausible a model in which mitochondrial protein translocation was first driven by tail-anchored proteins.\n",

      "The vast majority of polytopic membrane proteins are inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane of prokaryotes by the general secretory (Sec) pathway. However, a subset of monotopic proteins that contain non-covalently-bound redox cofactors depend on the twin-arginine translocase (Tat) machinery for membrane integration. Recently actinobacterial Rieske iron-sulfur cluster-containing proteins were identified as an unusual class of membrane proteins that require both the Sec and Tat pathways for the insertion of their three transmembrane domains (TMDs). The Sec pathway inserts the first two TMDs of these proteins co-translationally, but releases the polypeptide prior to the integration of TMD3 to allow folding of the cofactor-containing domain and its translocation by Tat. Here we have investigated features of the Streptomyces coelicolor Rieske polypeptide that modulate its interaction with the Sec and Tat machineries. Mutagenesis of a highly conserved loop region between Sec-dependent TMD2 and Tat-dependent TMD3 shows that it plays no significant role in coordinating the activities of the two translocases, but that a minimum loop length of approximately eight amino acids is required for the Tat machinery to recognise TMD3. Instead we show that a combination of relatively low hydrophobicity of TMD3, coupled with the presence of C-terminal positively-charged amino acids, results in abortive insertion of TMD3 by the Sec pathway and its release at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Bioinformatic analysis identified two further families of polytopic membrane proteins that share features of dual Sec-Tat-targeted membrane proteins. A predicted heme-molybdenum cofactor-containing protein with five TMDs, and a polyferredoxin also with five predicted TMDs, are encoded across bacterial and archaeal genomes. We demonstrate that membrane insertion of representatives of each of these newly-identified protein families is dependent on more than one protein translocase, with the Tat machinery recognising TMD5. Importantly, the combination of low hydrophobicity of the final TMD and the presence of multiple C-terminal positive charges that serve as critical Sec-release features for the actinobacterial Rieske protein also dictate Sec release in these further protein families. Therefore we conclude that a simple unifying mechanism governs the assembly of dual targeted membrane proteins.\n",
      "Modern advances in neurotechnology rely on effectively harnessing physical tools and insights towards remote neural control, thereby creating major new scientific and therapeutic opportunities. Specifically, rapid temperature pulses were shown to increase membrane capacitance, causing capacitive currents that explain neural excitation, but the underlying biophysics is not well understood. Here, we show that an intramembrane thermal-mechanical effect wherein the phospholipid bilayer undergoes axial narrowing and lateral expansion accurately predicts a potentially universal thermal capacitance increase rate of ~0.3%/{degrees}C. This capacitance increase and concurrent changes in the surface charge related fields lead to predictable exciting ionic displacement currents. The new theorys predictions provide an excellent agreement with multiple experimental results and indirect estimates of latent biophysical quantities. Our results further highlight the role of electro-mechanics in neural excitation; they may also help illuminate sub-threshold and novel physical cellular effects, and could potentially lead to advanced new methods for neural control.\n",

      "Ciliary stability and function are regulated by the covalent addition of polyglutamate and polyglycine chains to axonemal tubulin subunits. The Drosophila gene CG13442 encodes a predicted ubiquitin E3 ligase involved in the regulation of tubulin glycylation and glutamylation. Homologous to mammalian MARCH8, CG13442/dMARCH8 is required for male fertility. Sperm in dMARCH8 mutant testes appear to undergo a normal individualization process but fail to be transferred to the seminal vesicle. This phenotype is very similar to that of mutants in the Ntl gene, shown here to be a glycine transporter using a [3H]glycine uptake assay. Mutations in dMARCH8 are associated with a reduction of both polyglutamylation and polyglycylation of sperm tubulin. Polyglutamylation of tubulin is significantly increased in the Ntl- background, and recovers to wild-type levels in the Ntl--dMARCH8- double mutant background, indicating that glycine and glutamate compete for some common site(s) on tubulin molecules in this system. By analogy to the regulation of the mammalian glycine transporter GlyT2 through ubiquitin-mediated trafficking between the plasma membrane and endosome, dMARCH8 may target Ntl and glutamate transporters, or other upstream regulators of these proteins.\n",
      "Sphingolipids are essential components of cellular membranes and defects in their synthesis or degradation cause severe human diseases. The efficient degradation of sphingolipids in the lysosome requires lipid-binding saposin proteins and hydrolytic enzymes. The glycosphingolipid galactocerebroside is the primary lipid component of the myelin sheath and is degraded by the hydrolase {beta}-galactocerebrosidase (GALC). This enzyme requires the saposin SapA for lipid processing and defects in either of these proteins causes a severe neurodegenerative disorder, Krabbe disease. Here we present the structure of a glycosphingolipid-processing complex, revealing how SapA and GALC form a heterotetramer with an open channel connecting the enzyme active site to the SapA hydrophobic cavity. This structure defines how a soluble hydrolase can cleave the polar glycosyl headgroups of these essential lipids from their hydrophobic ceramide tails. Furthermore, the molecular details of this interaction reveal how specificity of saposin binding to hydrolases is encoded.\n",

The entire compendium of cell functions broadly mapped to four systems of distinct primary influence on the Size-Expression map. Specifically, membrane structural components primarily affected size, whereas protein and RNA stability primarily affected gene expression.

We have developed the first recombinant expression system in E. coli to produce a construct of human FGFR2 containing its transmembrane and extracellular receptor domains. We demonstrate that the expressed construct is functional in binding heparin and dimerizing. Size exclusion chromatography demonstrates that the purified FGFR2 does not form a complex with FGF1 or adopts an inactive dimer conformation.

However, 2D crystals diffracting to only 10-12 [A] can be prepared relatively conveniently in most cases. We have developed image-processing algorithms allowing to generate a high resolution 3D structure from cryo-electron crystallography images of badly ordered crystals. These include movie-mode unbending, refinement over sub-tiles of the images in order to locally refine the sample tilt geometry; implementation of different CTF correction schemes; and an iterative method to apply known constraints in the real and reciprocal space to approximate amplitudes and phases in the so-called missing cone regions. These algorithms applied to a dataset of the potassium channel MloK1 show significant resolution improvements to approximately 5[A].\\n\\nAbbreviations\n",
      "Precise tissue remodeling during development is essential for shaping embryos and for optimal organ function. Epiboly is an early gastrulation event by which the blastoderm expands around the yolk to engulf it. Three different layers are involved, an epithelial layer (the enveloping layer, EVL), the embryo proper, constituted by the deep cells (DCs), and the yolk cell. Although teleost epiboly has been studied for many years, a clear understanding of its mechanics was still missing. Here we present new information on the cellular, molecular and mechanical elements involved in epiboly that, together with some other recent data and upon comparison with previous biomechanical models, lets conclude that the expansion of the epithelia is passive and driven by cortical contraction and membrane removal in the adjacent layer, the External Yolk Syncytial Layer (E-YSL). The isotropic actomyosin contraction of the E-YSL generates an anisotropic stress pattern and a directional net movement as a result of the differences in the deformation response of two opposites adjacent domains (the EVL and the Yolk Cytoplasmic Layer - YCL). Contractility is accompanied by the local formation of membrane folds and the membrane removal by Rab5ab dependent macropinocytosis. The increase in area of the epithelia during the expansion is achieved by cell-shape changes (flattening) responding to spherical geometrical cues. The counterbalance between the geometry of the embryo and forces dissipation is therefore essential for epiboly global coordination.\n",
      "The twin arginine protein transport (Tat) machinery mediates the translocation of folded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane of prokaryotes and the thylakoid membrane of plant chloroplasts. The Escherichia coli Tat system comprises TatC and two additional sequence-related proteins, TatA and TatB. Here we use disulfide crosslinking and molecular modelling to show there are two binding sites for TatA/B proteins on TatC. TatA and TatB are each able to occupy both sites if they are the only TatA/B protein present. However, under resting conditions the sites are differentially occupied with TatB occupying the  polar cluster site while TatA binds adjacently at the TatC transmembrane helix 6 binding site. When the Tat system is activated by the overproduction of a substrate, TatA and TatB switch their binding sites. We propose that this substrate-triggered positional exchange is a key step in the assembly of an active Tat translocase.\n",
      "Chemotaxis is the movement of an organism in response to an external chemical stimulus. This system enables bacteria to sense their immediate environment and adapt to changes in its chemical composition. Bacterial chemotaxis is mediated by chemoreceptors, membrane proteins that bind an effector and transduce the signal to the downstream proteins. From a synthetic biology perspective, the natural chemotactic repertoire is of little use since bacterial chemoreceptors have evolved to sense specific ligands that either benefit or harm the cell. Here we demonstrate that using a combined computational design approach together with a quantitative, real-time, and digital detection approach, we can rapidly design, manufacture, and characterize a synthetic chemoreceptor in E. coli for histamine (a ligand for which there are no known chemoreceptors). First, we employed a computational protocol that uses the Rosetta bioinformatics software together with high threshold filters to design mutational variants to the native Tar ligand binding domain that target histamine. Second, we tested different ligand-chemoreceptors pairs with a novel chemotaxis assay, based on optical reflectance interferometry of porous silicon (PSi) optical transducers, enabling label-free quantification of chemotaxis by monitoring real-time changes in the optical readout (expressed as the effective optical thickness, EOT). We found that different ligands can be characterized by an individual set of fingerprints in our assay. Namely, a binary, digital-like response in EOT change (i.e. positive or negative) that differentiates between attractants and repellants, the amplitude of change of EOT response, and the rate by which steady state in EOT change is reached. Using this assay, we were able to positively identify and characterize a single mutational chemoreceptor variant for histamine that mediated chemotaxis comparably to the natural Tar-aspartate system. Our results demonstrate the possibility of not only expanding the natural chemotaxis repertoire, but also provide a new quantitative assay by which to characterize the efficacy of the chemotactic response.\n",
      "TRPV1 promotes cationic currents across cellular membranes in response to multiple stimuli such as increased temperature, binding of chemicals, low pH and voltage. The molecular underpinnings of TRPV1 gating, in particular the mechanism of temperature sensitivity, are still largely unknown. Here, we used molecular simulations and electrophysiology to shed light on the closed to open transition. Specifically, we found that gating of TRPV1 relies on the motion of an evolutionarily conserved amino acid (N676) in the middle of the S6 helix. On rotation, the side chain of this asparagine faces either the central pore or the S4-S5 linker. Only in the former case is the central pore hydrated and thus conductive. Interestingly, when N676 rotates toward the linker, we observe hydration of four so far unreported small nonpolar cavities. Based on these findings, we propose a model for TRPV1 gating involving the dynamic hydration of these four cavities. Free energy calculations indicate that this gating mechanisms is markedly temperature dependent favoring the open state at high temperature. On the basis of this model, which is able to rationalize a wealth of seemingly conflicting and/or unrelated experimental observations, we predicted the behavior of two single residue mutants, M572A and F580Y, the consequences of which we confirmed experimentally.\n",

      "Giardia is a highly prevalent, understudied protistan parasite causing significant diarrheal disease worldwide. Its life cycle consists of two stages: infectious cysts ingested from contaminated food or water sources, and motile trophozoites that colonize and attach to the gut epithelium, later encysting to form new cysts that are excreted into the environment. Current understanding of parasite physiology in the host is largely inferred from transcriptomic studies using Giardia grown axenically or in co-culture with mammalian cell lines. The dearth of information about the diversity of host-parasite interactions occurring within distinct regions of the gastrointestinal tract has been exacerbated by a lack of methods to directly and non-invasively interrogate disease progression and parasite physiology in live animal hosts. By visualizing Giardia infections in the mouse gastrointestinal tract using bioluminescent imaging (BLI) of tagged parasites, we recently showed that parasites colonize the gut in high-density foci that may cause localized pathology to the epithelium. Encystation is also initiated in these foci throughout the entire course of infection, yet how the physiology of parasites within high-density foci in the host gut differs from that of cells in laboratory culture is unclear. Here we use BLI to precisely select parasite samples from high-density foci in the proximal intestine to interrogate in vivo Giardia gene expression in the host. Relative to axenic culture, we noted significantly higher expression (> 10-fold) of oxidative stress, membrane transporter, and metabolic and structural genes associated with encystation in the high-density foci. These differences in gene expression within parasite foci in the host may reflect physiological changes associated with high-density growth in localized regions of the gut. We also identified and verified six novel cyst-specific proteins, including new components of the cyst wall that were highly expressed in these foci. Our in vivo transcriptome data support an emerging view that parasites encyst early in localized regions in the gut, possibly as a consequence of nutrient limitation, and also impact local metabolism and physiology.\n",

      "The mechanism underlying selective myelination of axons versus dendrites or neuronal somata relies on the expression of somatodendritic membrane myelination inhibitors (i.e. JAM2). However, axons still present long unmyelinated segments proposed to contribute to axonal plasticity and higher order brain functions. Why these segments remain unmyelinated is still an unresolved issue. The bifunctional lectin galectin-4 (Gal-4) organizes the transport of axon glycoproteins by binding to N-acetyllactosamine (LacNac) termini of N-glycans. We have shown that Gal-4 is sorted to segmental domains (G4Ds) along the axon surface, reminiscent of these long unmyelinated axon segments in cortical neurons. We report here that oligodendrocytes (OLGs) do not deposit myelin on Gal-4 covered surfaces or myelinate axonal G4Ds. In addition, Gal-4 interacts and co-localizes in G4Ds with contactin-1, a marker of non-myelinated nodes of Ranvier. Neither Gal-4 expression nor G4D dimensions are affected by myelin extracts or myelinating OLGs, but are reduced with neuron maturation. As in vitro, Gal-4 is consistently segregated from myelinated structures in the brain. Our data shape the novel concept that neurons establish and regulate axon membrane domains expressing Gal-4, the first inhibitor of myelination identified in axons, whose boundaries delineate myelination-incompetent axon segments along neuron development.\n",
      "Identifying co-regulated genes can provide a useful approach for defining pathway-specific machinery in an organism. To be efficient, this approach relies on thorough genome annotation, which is not available for most organisms with sequenced genomes. Studies in Tetrahymena thermophila, the most experimentally accessible ciliate, have generated a rich transcriptomic database covering many well-defined physiological states. Genes that are involved in the same pathway show significant co-regulation, and screens based on gene co-regulation have identified novel factors in specific pathways, for example in membrane trafficking. However, a limitation has been the relatively sparse annotation of the Tetrahymena genome, making it impractical to approach genome-wide analyses. We have therefore developed an efficient approach to analyze both co-regulation and gene annotation, called the Co-regulation Data Harvester (CDH). The CDH automates identification of co-regulated genes by accessing the Tetrahymena transcriptome database, determines their orthologs in other organisms via reciprocal BLAST searches, and collates the annotations of those orthologs' functions. Inferences drawn from the CDH reproduce and expand upon experimental findings in Tetrahymena. The CDH, which is freely available, represents a powerful new tool for analyzing cell biological pathways in Tetrahymena. Moreover, to the extent that genes and pathways are conserved between organisms, the inferences obtained via the CDH should be relevant, and can be explored, in many other systems.\n",
      "Precise coordination of synaptic connections ensures proper information flow within circuits. The activity of presynaptic organizing molecules signaling to downstream pathways is essential for such coordination, though such entities remain incompletely known. We show that LRP4, a conserved transmembrane protein known for its postsynaptic roles, functions presynaptically as an organizing molecule. In the Drosophila brain, LRP4 preferentially localizes to excitatory neuron terminals at or near active zones. Loss of presynaptic LRP4 reduces excitatory (not inhibitory) synapse number, impairs active zone architecture, and abolishes olfactory attraction - the latter of which can be suppressed by reducing presynaptic GABAB receptors. LRP4 overexpression increases synapse number in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, suggesting an instructive role and a common downstream synapse addition pathway. Mechanistically, LRP4 functions via the conserved kinase SRPK79D to ensure normal synapse number and behavior. This highlights a presynaptic function for LRP4, enabling deeper understanding of how synapse organization is coordinated.\n",
      "SUMMARY STATEMENTOur study demonstrates compositional and structural differences of the nuclear pore complex between the functionally differentiated macronucleus and micronucleus within a single cytoplasm of ciliated protozoa.\\n\\nABSTRACTThe nuclear pore complex (NPC), a gateway for nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, is composed of about 30 different proteins called nucleoporins. It remains unknown whether the NPCs within a species are homogeneous or vary depending on the cell type, or physiological condition. Here, we present evidence for compositionally distinct NPCs that form within a single cell in a binucleated ciliate. In Tetrahymena thermophila, each cell contains both a transcriptionally-active macronucleus (MAC) and a germline micronucleus (MIC). By combining in silico analysis, mass spectrometry analysis for immuno-isolated proteins, and subcellular localization analysis of GFP fused proteins, we identified numerous novel components of MAC and MIC NPCs. Core members of the Nup107-160 scaffold complex were enriched in MIC NPCs. Strikingly, two paralogs of Nup214 and of Nup153 localized exclusively to either MAC or MIC NPCs. Furthermore, the transmembrane components Pom121 and Pom82 localize exclusively to MAC and MIC NPCs, respectively. Our results argue that functional nuclear dimorphism in ciliates is likely to depend on compositional and structural specificity of NPCs.\n",

      "The plant Golgi apparatus modifies and sorts incoming proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and synthesises cell wall matrix material. Plant cells possess numerous motile Golgi bodies, which are connected to the ER by yet to be identified tethering factors. Previous studies indicated a role of cis-Golgi plant golgins (long coiled-coil domains proteins anchored to Golgi membranes) in Golgi biogenesis. Here we show a tethering role for the golgin AtCASP at the ER-Golgi interface. Using live-cell imaging, Golgi body dynamics were compared in Arabidopsis thaliana leaf epidermal cells expressing fluorescently tagged AtCASP, a truncated AtCASP-{Delta}CC lacking the coiled-coil domains, and the Golgi marker STtmd. Golgi body speed and displacement were significantly reduced in AtCASP-{Delta}CC lines. Using a dual-colour optical trapping system and a TIRF-tweezer system, individual Golgi bodies were captured in planta. Golgi bodies in AtCASP-{Delta}CC lines were easier to trap, and the ER-Golgi connection was more easily disrupted. Occasionally, the ER tubule followed a trapped Golgi body with a gap, indicating the presence of other tethering factors. Our work confirms that the intimate ER-Golgi association can be disrupted or weakened by expression of truncated AtCASP-{Delta}CC, and suggests that this connection is most likely maintained by a golgin-mediated tethering complex.\\n\\nHighlightHere we show that the Golgi-associated Arabidopsis thaliana protein AtCASP may form part of a golgin-mediated tethering complex involved in anchoring plant Golgi stacks to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).\n",
      "FimV is a Pseudomonas aeruginosa inner membrane hub protein that modulates levels of the second messenger, cyclic AMP (cAMP), through activation of the adenylate cyclase, CyaB. Although type IVa pilus (T4aP)-dependent twitching motility is modulated by cAMP levels, mutants lacking FimV are twitching impaired, even when exogenous cAMP is provided. Here we further define FimVs cAMP-dependent and -independent regulation of twitching. We confirmed that the response regulator of the T4aP-associated Chp chemotaxis system, PilG, required both FimV and the CyaB regulator, FimL, to activate CyaB. However, in cAMP-replete backgrounds - lacking the cAMP phosphodiesterase CpdA or the CheY-like protein PilH, or expressing constitutively-active CyaB - pilG and fimV mutants failed to twitch. Both cytoplasmic and periplasmic domains of FimV were important for its cAMP-dependent and -independent roles, while its septal peptidoglycan-targeting LysM motif was required only for twitching motility. Polar localization of the sensor kinase PilS, a key regulator of transcription of the major pilin, was FimV-dependent. However, unlike its homologues in other species that localize flagellar system components, FimV was not required for swimming motility. These data provide further evidence to support FimVs role as a key hub protein that coordinates the polar localization and function of multiple structural and regulatory proteins involved in P. aeruginosa twitching motility.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEPseudomonas aeruginosa is a serious opportunistic pathogen. Type IVa pili (T4aP) are important for its virulence, because they mediate dissemination and invasion via twitching motility, and are involved in surface sensing which modulates pathogenicity via changes in cAMP levels. Here we show that the hub protein FimV and the response regulator of the Chp system, PilG, regulate twitching independently of their roles in modulation of cAMP synthesis. These functions do not require the putative scaffold protein FimL, proposed to link PilG with FimV. PilG may regulate asymmetric functioning of the T4aP system to allow for directional movement, while FimV appears to localize both structural and regulatory elements - including the PilSR two-component system - to cell poles for optimal function.\n",

      "Non-membrane bound, hydrogel-like entities, such as RNA granules, nucleate essential cellular functions through their unique physico-chemical properties. However, these intracellular hydrogels have not been as extensively studied as their extracellular counterparts, primarily due to technical challenges in probing these materials in situ. Here, by taking advantage of a chemically inducible dimerization paradigm, we developed iPOLYMER, a strategy for rapid induction of protein-based hydrogels inside living cells. A series of biochemical and biophysical characterizations, in conjunction with computational modeling, revealed that the polymer network formed in the cytosol resembles a physiological hydrogel-like entity that behaves as a size-dependent molecular sieve. We studied several properties of the gel and functionalized it with RNA binding motifs that sequester polyadenine-containing nucleotides to synthetically mimic RNA granules. Therefore, we here demonstrate that iPOLYMER presents a unique and powerful approach to synthetically reconstitute hydrogel-like structures including RNA granules in intact cells.\n",
      "Bacteria have garnered increased interest in recent years as a platform for the biosynthesis of a variety of glycomolecules such as soluble oligosaccharides, surface-exposed carbohydrates and glycoproteins. The ability to flexibly engineer commonly used laboratory species such as Escherichia coli to efficiently synthesize non-native sugar structures by recombinant expression of enzymes from various carbohydrate biosynthesis pathways has allowed for the facile generation of important products such as conjugate vaccines, glycosylated outer membrane vesicles, and a variety of other research reagents for studying and understanding the role of glycans in living systems. This chapter highlights some of the key discoveries and technologies for equipping bacteria with the requisite biosynthetic machinery to generate such products. As the bacterial glyco-toolbox continues to grow, these technologies are expected to expand the range of glycomolecules produced recombinantly in bacterial systems, thereby opening up this platform to an even larger number of applications.\n",
      "A broad range of health benefits have been attributed to resveratrol (RSV) supplementation in mammalian systems, including the increases in longevity. Nonetheless, despite the growing number of studies performed with RSV, the molecular mechanism by which it acts still remains unknown. Recently, it has been proposed that inhibition of the oxidative phosphorylation activity is the principal mechanism of RSV action. This mechanism suggests that RSV might induce mitochondrial dysfunction resulting in oxidative damage to cells with a concomitant decrease of cell viability and cellular life span. To prove this hypothesis, the chronological life span (CLS) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was studied as it is accepted as an important model of oxidative damage and aging. In addition, oxygen consumption, mitochondrial membrane potential, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release were measured in order to determine the extent of mitochondrial dysfunction. The results demonstrated that the supplementation of S. cerevisiae cultures with 100 M RSV decreased CLS in a glucose-dependent manner. At high-level glucose, RSV supplementation increased oxygen consumption during the exponential phase yeast cultures, but inhibited it in chronologically aged yeast cultures. However, at low-level glucose, oxygen consumption was inhibited in yeast cultures in the exponential phase as well as in chronologically aged cultures. Furthermore, RSV supplementation promoted the polarization of the mitochondrial membrane in both cultures. Finally, RSV decreased the release of H2O2 with high-level glucose and increased it at low-level glucose. Altogether, this data supports the hypothesis that RSV supplementation decreases CLS as a result of mitochondrial dysfunction and this phenotype occurs in a glucose-dependent manner.\n",
      "The voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 plays a critical role in pain pathways. Besides action potential propagation, NaV1.7 regulates neurotransmitter release, integrates depolarizing inputs over long periods and regulates transcription. In order to better understand these functions, we generated an epitope-tagged NaV1.7 mouse that showed normal pain behavior. Analysis of NaV1.7 complexes affinity-purified under native conditions by mass spectrometry revealed 267 NaV1.7 associated proteins including known interactors, such as the sodium channel {beta}3 subunit (Scn3b) and collapsin response mediator protein (Crmp2), and novel interactors. Selected novel NaV1.7 protein interactors membrane-trafficking protein synapototagmin-2 (Syt2), G protein-regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1 (Gprin1), L-type amino acid transporter 1 (Lat1) and transmembrane P24 trafficking protein 10 (Tmed10) together with Scn3b and Crmp2 were validated using co-immunoprecipitation and functional assays.

      "By electron cryo-tomography and subtomogram averaging, translation-arrested ribosomes were used to depict the clustered organisation of the TOM complex on the surface of mitochondria, corroborating earlier reports of localized translation. Ribosomes were shown to interact specifically with the TOM complex and nascent chain binding was crucial for ribosome recruitment and stabilization. Ribosomes were bound to the membrane in discrete clusters, often in the vicinity of the crista junctions. This interaction highlights how protein synthesis may be coupled with transport, and the importance of spatial organization for efficient mitochondrial protein import.\n",
      "Bacteria within biofilms can coordinate their behavior through distinct from of communication mechanism1. The well-established cell - to - cell signaling process in bacteria is known as quorum sensing through chemical signaling molecules2-5. Recently, another cell- to - cell communication process based on ion channel mediated electrical signaling6 has also been observed. In this article, we propose a novel approach to explain the role of coherence and phase synchronization in the cell - to - cell bacterial communication. The observable long - range coherent electrical signaling is species independent and it is caused by membrane - potential - dependent modulation of tumbling frequency7-9. Moreover, noise can play a constructive role in enhancing the synchronization of chaotic bacterial communication systems and noise associated with the opening and closing the gate of ion channel induce small kinetic viscosity that make a wave-like pattern in concentration profile of quorum sensing.\n",
      "In the nervous system, communication occurs via synaptic transmission where signaling molecules (neurotransmitters) are released by the presynaptic neuron, and they influence electrical activity of another neuron (postsynaptic neuron). The inherent probabilistic release of neurotransmitters is a significant source of noise that critically impacts the timing of spikes (action potential) in the postsynaptic neuron. We develop a stochastic model that incorporates noise mechanisms in synaptic transmission, such as, random docking of neurotransmitter-filled vesicle to a finite number of docking sites, with each site having a probability of vesicle release upon arrival of an action potential. This random, burst-like release of neurotransmitters serves as an input to an integrate-and-fire model, where spikes in the postsynaptic neuron are triggered when its membrane potential reaches a critical threshold for the first time. We derive novel analytical results for the probability distribution function of spike timing, and systematically investigate how underlying model parameters and noise processes regulate variability in the inter-spike times. Interestingly, in some parameter regimes, independent arrivals of action potentials in the presynaptic neuron generate strong dependencies in the spike timing of the postsynaptic neuron. Finally, we argue that probabilistic release of neurotransmitters is not only a source of disturbance, but plays a beneficial role in synaptic information processing.\n",
      "FGFR1 represents an important target for precision medicine and a detailed molecular understanding of the target is important in order to increase the efficacy of FGFR inhibitors. We have here applied proximity labelling of FGFR1 in an osteosarcoma cell line to identify determinants of FGFR1 activity. Many known FGFR interactors were identified (e.g. FRS2, PLC{gamma}, RSK2, SHC4, SRC), but the data also suggested novel determinants. A strong hit in our screen was the tyrosine phosphatase PTPRG. We show that PTPRG and FGFR1 interact and colocalize at the plasma membrane where PTPRG directly dephosphorylates activated FGFR1. We further show that osteosarcoma cell lines depleted for PTPRG display increased FGFR activity and are hypersensitive to stimulation by FGF1. In addition, PTPRG depletion elevated cell growth and negatively affected the efficacy of FGFR kinase inhibitors. Thus, PTPRG may have future clinical relevance by being a predictor of outcome after FGFR inhibitor treatment.\n",
      "Bicaudal D2 (BICD2) joins dynein with dynactin into a ternary complex (termed DDB) capable of processive movement. Point mutations in the BICD2 gene have been identified in patients with a dominant form of spinal muscular atrophy, but how these mutations cause disease is unknown. To investigate this question, we have developed in vitro motility assays with purified DDB and BICD2s membrane vesicle partner, the GTPase Rab6a. Rab6a-GTP, either in solution or bound to artificial liposomes, released BICD2 from an autoinhibited state and promoted robust dynein-dynactin transport. In these assays, BICD2 mutants showed an enhanced ability to form motile DDB complexes. Increased retrograde transport by BICD2 mutants also was observed in cells using an inducible organelle transport assay. When overexpressed in rat hippocampal neurons, the hyperactive BICD2 mutants decreased neurite growth. Our results reveal that dominant mutations in BICD2 hyperactivate DDB motility and suggest that an imbalance of minus- versus plus-end-directed microtubule motility in neurons may underlie spinal muscular atrophy.\n",

      "Our study revealed the presence of all major classes of chromatophores (melanophores, xanthophores, erythrophores, violet-blue iridophores, xantho-erythrophores) and crystalline platelets in various combinations in the iris and ocular media (cornea, aqueous humor, vitreous humor, outer lens membrane) of Poecilia reticulata. This novel ocular media study of P. reticulata takes into account the distinct interactions of Purple Body (Pb) based on results of previous Bias and Squire Purple Body (Pb) publications. Taken in conjunction with other researchers published results (regarding UV reflected color and pattern, vision, mate choice, individual preferences, and opsin capabilities) this indicates that these ocular chromatophore populations together create a complex ocular filter mechanism. This mechanism in turn provides spectral capabilities into the UV and Near-UV wavelengths in both Pb and non-Pb individuals. The chromatophores in the cornea, aqueous humor, covering membranes of the lens, and the vitreous humor comprise an ocular filter system that could reduce UV damage to the internal structures of the eye. The guppys ability to use UVA as a visual component provides a \\\"private signally system\\\" that cannot be detected by some predators. While non-Pb guppies should derive benefit in the near-UV from violet-blue iridophore units, greater benefit will be derived by Pb individuals with more violet iridophores functioning in the lower UV and near-UV wavelengths. To our knowledge little has been published for P. reticulata concerning pigmentation within the guppy eye. Macroscopic and microscopic imagery is presented.\n",
      "Many proteins are translocated across biomembranes via protein translocons in targeting to their subcellular destinations. Hitherto, the SecYEG/Sec61 translocon, existing in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, represents the most intensively studied one. According to the current perception, both periplasmic and {beta}-barrel outer membrane proteins ({beta}-barrel OMPs) are translocated via the SecYEG translocon in bacterial cells, although direct living cell evidences remain lacking. Here, mainly via in vivo protein photo-crosslinking analysis, we revealed that the never reported membrane-integrated SecAN protein apparently functions as the translocon for {beta}-barrel OMPs. Additionally, SecAN contains a GXXXG motif known for mediating protein interactions in biomembranes, and processing of {beta}-barrel OMP precursors was severely affected in cells producing an assembly-defective SecAN variant resulted from the GXXXG motif mutations. Furthermore, SecAN was demonstrated to directly interact with the Bam complex, thus likely be a part of the supercomplex that we revealed earlier to be responsible for {beta}-barrel OMP biogenesis.\n",

      "Proper neural circuit formation requires the precise regulation of neuronal migration, axon guidance and dendritic arborization. Mutations affecting the function of the transmembrane glycoprotein dystroglycan cause a form of congenital muscular dystrophy that is frequently associated with neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Despite its importance in brain development, the role for dystroglycan in regulating retinal development remains poorly understood. Using a mouse model of dystroglycanopathy (ISPDL79*) and conditional dystroglycan mutants of both sexes, we show that dystroglycan is critical for the proper migration, axon guidance and dendritic stratification of neurons in the inner retina. Using genetic approaches, we show that dystroglycan functions in neuroepithelial cells as an extracellular scaffold to maintain the integrity of the retinal inner limiting membrane (ILM). Surprisingly, despite the profound disruptions in inner retinal circuit formation, spontaneous retinal activity is preserved. These results highlight the importance of dystroglycan in coordinating multiple aspects of retinal development.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe extracellular environment plays a critical role in coordinating neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth during neural circuit development. The transmembrane glycoprotein dystroglycan functions as a receptor for multiple extracellular matrix proteins, and its dysfunction leads to a form of muscular dystrophy frequently associated with neurodevelopmental defects. Our results demonstrate that dystroglycan is required for maintaining the structural integrity of the inner limiting membrane (ILM) in the developing retina. In the absence of functional dystroglycan, ILM degeneration leads to defective migration, axon guidance and mosaic spacing of neurons, and a loss of multiple neuron types during retinal development. These results demonstrate that disorganization of retinal circuit development is a likely contributor to visual dysfunction in patients with dystroglycanopathy.\n",

      "We previously reported that Acb1, a cytoplasmic protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that cannot enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), was secreted upon nutrient starvation by a Vps4 independent, but ESCRT-I, -II and -III and Grh1 dependent pathway (Curwin et al., 2016). Here, we report that the same conditions result in secretion of another signal sequence lacking protein, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). Similar to Acb1, SOD1 export requires Grh1 and a subset of ESCRT components. Importantly, our analysis reveals the existence of a conserved di-acidic motif (Asp-Glu) in SOD1 and Acb1 that is required for their respective export. This sequence is different from the di-acidic motif (Asp-X-Glu) necessary for export of transmembrane proteins from the ER. We propose that the Asp-Glu sequence acts as a targeting motif for the entry of SOD1 and Acb1, and likely many other proteins, upon nutrient starvation into a common albeit ER-Golgi independent pathway of secretion.\n",
      "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) involves nanoscale bending and inward budding of the plasma membrane, by which cells regulate both the distribution of membrane proteins and the entry of extracellular species1,2. Extensive studies have shown that CME proteins actively modulate the plasma membrane curvature1,3,4. However, the reciprocal regulation of how plasma membrane curvature affects the activities of endocytic proteins is much less explored, despite studies suggesting that membrane curvature itself can trigger biochemical reactions5-8. This gap in our understanding is largely due to technical challenges in precisely controlling the membrane curvature in live cells. In this work, we use patterned nanostructures to generate well-defined membrane curvatures ranging from +50 nm to -500 nm radius of curvature. We find that the positively curved membranes are CME hotspots, and that key CME proteins, clathrin and dynamin, show a strong preference toward positive membrane curvatures with a radius < 200 nm. Of ten CME related proteins we examined, all show preferences to positively curved membrane. By contrast, other membrane-associated proteins and non-CME endocytic protein, caveolin1, show no such curvature preference. Therefore, nanostructured substrates constitute a novel tool for investigating curvature-dependent processes in live cells.\n",
      "Although recent evidence has pointed to the existence of small open reading frame (smORF)-encoded microproteins in mammals, the functional repertoire of this microproteome remains to be determined1. In skeletal muscle, proper development requires fusion of mononuclear progenitors to form multinucleated myotubes, a critical but poorly understood process2,3. Here we report the identification of a small ORF encoding an essential skeletal muscle specific microprotein we term Minion (microprotein inducer of fusion). Myogenic progenitors lacking Minion differentiate normally but fail to form syncytial myotubes, and Minion-deficient mice die perinatally with marked reduction in fused muscle fibers. This fusogenic activity is conserved to the human Minion ortholog, previously annotated as a long noncoding RNA. Loss-of-function studies demonstrate that Minion is the factor providing muscle specific fusogenic function for the transmembrane protein Myomaker4. Remarkably, we demonstrate that co-expression of Minion and Myomaker is sufficient to induce rapid cytoskeletal rearrangement and homogeneous cellular fusion, even in non-muscle cells. These findings establish Minion as a novel microprotein required for muscle development, and define a two-component program for the induction of mammalian cell fusion, enabling both research and translational applications. Importantly, these data also significantly expand the known functions of smORF-encoded microproteins, an under-explored source of proteomic diversity.\n",
      "526-residue FUS functions to self-assemble into reversible droplets/hydrogels, which could be further solidified into pathological fibrils. FUS is composed of N-terminal low-sequence complexity (LC); RNA-recognition motif (RRM) and C-terminal LC domains. FUS belongs to an emerging category of proteins which are capable of forming membraneless organelles in cells via phase separation. On the other hand, eukaryotic cells contain a large network of internal membrane systems. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to address whether membraneless organelles can interact with membranes. Here we attempted to explore this by NMR HSQC titrations of three FUS domains with gradual addition of DMPC/DHPC bicelle, which mimics the bilayer membrane. We found that both N- and C-terminal LC domains showed no significant interaction with bicelle, but its well-folded RRM domain does dynamically interact with bicelle with an interface opposite to that for binding nucleic acids including RNA and ssDNA. If this in vitro observation also occurs in cells, to interact with membrane might represent a mechanism for dynamically organizing membraneless organelles to membranes to facilitate their physiological functions.\n",
      "An intergenic region of human Chromosome 2 (2p25.3) harbours genetic variants which are among those most strongly and reproducibly associated with obesity. The molecular mechanisms mediating these effects remain entirely unknown. The gene closest to these variants is TMEM18, encoding a transmembrane protein localised to the nuclear membrane. The expression of Tmem18 within the murine hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus was altered by changes in nutritional state, with no significant change seen in three other closest genes. Germline loss of Tmem18 in mice resulted in increased body weight, which was exacerbated by high fat diet and driven by increased food intake. Selective overexpression of Tmem18 in the PVN of wild-type mice reduced food intake and also increased energy expenditure. We confirmed the nuclear membrane localisation of TMEM18 but provide new evidence that it is has four, not three, transmembrane domains and that it physically interacts with key components of the nuclear pore complex. Our data support the hypothesis that TMEM18 itself, acting within the central nervous system, is a plausible mediator of the impact of adjacent genetic variation on human adiposity.\n",
      "Zippering of SNARE complexes spanning docked membranes is essential for most intracellular fusion events. Here we explore how SNARE regulators operate on discrete zippering states. The formation of a metastable trans-complex, catalyzed by HOPS and its SM subunit Vps33, is followed by subsequent zippering transitions that increase the probability of fusion. Operating independently of Sec18 catalysis, Sec17 either inhibits or stimulates SNARE-mediated fusion. If HOPS or Vps33 are absent, Sec17 inhibits fusion at an early stage. Thus, HOPS and Vps33 accelerate SNARE zippering, particularly in the presence of otherwise inhibitory Sec17. Once SNAREs are partially-zipped, Sec17 promotes fusion in either the presence or absence of HOPS -- but with faster kinetics when HOPS is absent. Our data further indicate that Sec17 promotes fusion both through its direct penetration of the membrane and by enhancing C-terminal SNARE zippering. In a working model, the interplay among Sec17, Sec18, SMs, and SNARE zippering can explain why SM proteins are indispensable for SNARE-mediated fusion in vivo.\\n\\nImpact statementSec17 is shown to have divergent effects on pre-fusion SNARE complex activity, depending on the state of SNARE zippering. HOPS, an SM-tether complex, controls the outcome of Sec17-SNARE engagement. The results suggest a coherent working model for SM activity in vivo.\n",
      "Despite the importance of cell fusion for mammalian development and physiology, the factors critical for this process remain to be fully defined1. This lack of knowledge has severely limited our ability to reconstitute cell fusion, which is necessary to decipher the biochemical mechanisms driving plasma membrane merger. Myomaker (Tmem8c) is a muscle-specific protein required for myoblast fusion2,3. Expression of myomaker in fibroblasts drives their fusion with myoblasts, but not with other myomaker-fibroblasts, highlighting the requirement of additional myoblast-derived factors for fusion. Here, we demonstrate that Gm7325, named myomerger, induces the fusion of myomaker-expressing fibroblasts. Cell mixing experiments reveal that while myomaker renders cells fusion-competent, myomerger induces fusogenicity. Thus, myomaker and myomerger confer fusogenic activity to normally non-fusogenic cells. Myomerger is skeletal muscle-specific and only expressed during developmental and regenerative myogenesis. Disruption of myomerger in myoblast cell lines through Cas9-mutagenesis generated non-fusogenic myocytes. Genetic deletion of myomerger in mice results in a paucity of muscle fibers demonstrating a requirement for myomerger in normal muscle formation. Myomerger deficient myocytes exhibit an ability to differentiate and harbor organized sarcomeres, however remain mono-nucleated. These data identify myomerger as a fundamental myoblast fusion protein and establishes a system that begins to reconstitute mammalian cell fusion.\n",
      "The assessment of drug-target engagement for determining the efficacy of a compound inside cells remains challenging, particularly for difficult target proteins. Existing techniques are more suited to soluble protein targets. Difficult target proteins include those with challenging in vitro solubility, stability or purification properties that preclude target isolation. Here, we report a novel technique that measures intracellular compound-target complex formation, as well as cellular permeability, specificity and cytotoxicity - the Toxicity-Affinity-Permeability-Selectivity (TAPS) technique. The TAPS assay is exemplified here using human kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), a challenging intracellular membrane protein target of significant current interest. TAPS confirmed target binding of known KMO inhibitors inside cells. We conclude that the TAPS assay can be used to facilitate intracellular hit validation on most, if not all intracellular drug targets.\n",
      "The Golgi is the cellular hub for complex glycosylation, controlling accurate processing of complex proteoglycans, receptors, ligands, and glycolipids. Its structure and organisation is dependent on golgins, which tether cisternal membranes and incoming transport vesicles. Here we show that knockout of the largest golgin, giantin, leads to substantial changes in gene expression despite only limited effects on Golgi structure. Notably, 22 Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases, but not glycan processing enzymes or the ER glycosylation machinery, are differentially expressed following giantin ablation. This includes near-complete loss-of-function of GALNT3 in both mammalian cell and zebrafish models. Giantin knockout zebrafish exhibit hyperostosis and ectopic calcium deposits, recapitulating phenotypes of hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis, a disease caused by mutations in GALNT3. These data reveal a new feature of Golgi homeostasis, the ability to regulate glycosyltransferase expression to generate a functional proteoglycome.\\n\\nSummary statementKnockout of giantin in a genome-engineered cell line and zebrafish models reveals the capacity of the Golgi to control its own biochemistry through changes in gene expression.\n",

      "During its life cycle, Caulobacter crescentus undergoes a series of coordinated shape changes, including generation of a polar stalk and reshaping of the cell envelope to produce new daughter cells through the process of cytokinesis. The mechanisms by which these morphogenetic processes are coordinated in time and space remain largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that the conserved division complex FtsEX controls both the early and late stages of cytokinesis in C. crescentus, namely initiation of constriction and final cell separation. {Delta}ftsE cells display a striking phenotype: cells are chained, with skinny connections between cell bodies resulting from defects in inner membrane fusion and cell separation. Surprisingly, the thin connections in {Delta}ftsE cells share morphological and molecular features with C. crescentus stalks. Our data uncover unanticipated morphogenetic plasticity in C. crescentus, with loss of FtsE causing a stalk-like program to take over at failed division sites and yield novel cell morphology.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBacterial cell shape is genetically hardwired and is critical for fitness and, in certain cases, pathogenesis. In most bacteria, a semi-rigid structure called the cell wall surrounds the inner membrane, offering protection against cell lysis while simultaneously maintaining cell shape. A highly dynamic macromolecular structure, the cell wall undergoes extensive remodeling as bacterial cells grow and divide. We demonstrate that a broadly conserved cell division complex, FtsEX, relays signals from the cytoplasm to the cell wall to regulate key developmental shape changes in the -proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Consistent with studies in diverse bacteria, we observe strong synthetic interactions between ftsE and cell wall hydrolytic factors, suggesting that regulation of cell wall remodeling is a conserved function of FtsEX. Loss of FtsE causes morphological defects associated with both the early and late stages of division. Intriguingly, without FtsE, cells frequently fail to separate and instead elaborate a thin, tubular structure between cell bodies, a growth mode observed in other -proteobacteria. Overall, our results highlight the plasticity of bacterial cell shape and demonstrate how altering the activity of one morphogenetic program can produce diverse morphologies resembling those of other bacteria in nature.\n",
      "Playing a central role in cell signalling, GPCRs have evolved into the largest superfamily of membrane proteins and form the majority of drug targets in humans. How extracellular agonist binding triggers the activation of GPCRs and associated intracellular effector proteins remains, however, poorly understood. High resolution structural studies have recently revealed that inactive class-A GPCRs harbour a conserved binding site for Na+ ions in the centre of their transmembrane domain, accessible from the extracellular space. Here, we show that the opening of a conserved hydrated channel in the activated state receptors allows the Na+ ion to egress from its binding site into the cytosol. Coupled with protonation changes, this ion movement occurs without significant energy barriers, and can be driven by physiological transmembrane ion and voltage gradients. We propose that Na+ ion exchange with the cytosol is a key step in GPCR activation, which locks receptors in long-lived active-state conformations.\n",

      "Alteration of single protein regulation has given a massive implication in Muscular Dystrophy pathogenesis. Herein, we investigated the contribution of defected dystrophin that has impaired PI3K/Akt signalling and subsequently reduced autophagy in dystrophin-deficient myoblasts. In this study, dfd13 (dystrophin-deficient) and C2C12 (non-dystrophic) myoblasts were cultured in low mitogen condition for 10 days to induce differentiation. Analyses of protein expression has been done by using immunoblot technique, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. In our myoblasts differentiation system, the dfd13 myoblasts did not achieved terminal differentiation as fewer myotube formation and fast-myosin heavy chain expression almost not detected. Immunoblot analysis showed that PTEN expression is profoundly increased in dfd13 myoblasts throughout the differentiation day. As a result, the PI3K activity is decreased and has caused serine/threonine kinase Akt inactivation. Both residues; Thr308 and Ser473, on Akt were found not phosphorylated. The mTOR activation by Ser2448 phosphorylation was decreased indicates an impairment for raptor and rictor binding. Unable to form complexes; mTORC1 target protein, p70S6K1 activation was found reduced at the same time explained un-phosphorylated-Akt at Ser473 by rictor-mTORC2. As one of Akt downstream protein, transcription factor FoxO3 regulation was found impaired as it was highly expressed and highly mainly localised in the nucleus in dfd13 towards the end of the differentiation day. This occurrence has caused higher activation of autophagy related genes; Beclin1, Atg5, Atg7, in dfd13 myoblasts. Autophagosome formation was increased as LC3B-I/II showed accumulation upon differentiation. However, ratio of LC3B lipidation and autophagic flux were shown decreased which exhibited dystrophic features. As a conclusion, destabilisation of plasma membrane owing to dystrophin mutation has caused the alteration of plasma membrane protein regulation particularly PTEN-PI3K, thus impaired autophagy modulation that critical for myoblasts development.\n",
      "The family of reticulon proteins has been shown to be involved in a variety of functions in eukaryotic cells including tubulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), formation of cell plates and primary plasmodesmata.

      "The c-Fes protein tyrosine kinase is a proto-oncogene that can also act as a tumor suppressor. We implemented an unbiased phosphoproteomics-based analysis that establishes cognate kinase-substrate associations, and revealed that c-Fes directly phosphorylates Dok1, Ptpn18 and Sts1, facilitating recruitment of the Src inhibitory kinase Csk to these substrates. These interactions resulted in modulation of Src signaling following B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation and subsequent alteration of the protein levels of CD19, a membrane-localized BCR co-receptor and emerging key protein affecting the development of B- and plasma cell-lymphoma. Strikingly, manipulating c-Fes expression levels drove opposing biological outcomes. Low-level exogenous c-Fes expression led to a strong increase in CD19 protein levels while high c-Fes expression abolished CD19 protein levels.

      "The soluble domain of cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (COX2), located in the outer side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, contains a binuclear copper site (CuA) through which electrons flow from cytochrome c to the core of the oxidase where oxygen reduction takes place. Being COX2 encoded in the mitochondrial genome, newly synthesized protein undergoes maturation steps in which it is translocated through and inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane, and copper ions are loaded to form the CuA site. These steps are ensured by several protein factors in a complex pathway that is not fully understood, including copper-loading and disulfide-reduction proteins plus chaperones that assist proper membrane insertion. While the structure and function of copper-loading and disulfide-reducing proteins Sco1 and Sco2 have been quite studied at atomistic level, the latest biological studies have uncovered roles for other proteins that are not yet much understood at the structural level. In particular, recent experiments showed that membrane protein COX18 is a membrane-protein insertase for COX2, whereas membrane protein COX20 is a chaperone that stabilizes COX2 during translocation through the inner mitochondrial membrane, and soluble protein COA6 is part of the copper-loading pathway in conjunction with Sco1 and Sco2. This work reports structural models for COX18, COX20 and COA6, built judiciously from homology modeling, contact prediction-based modeling and transmembrane helix predictions, while considering the underlying biology. Implications and limitations of the models are discussed, and possible experimental routes to pursue are proposed.

      "The ability of Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) to transform resting cell B-cells into immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) provides a continuous source of peripheral blood lymphocytes that are used to model conditions in which these lymphocytes play a key role. Here, the PacBio generated transcriptome of three LCLs from a parent-daughter trio (SRAid:SRP036136) provided by a previous study [1] were analyzed using a kmer-based version of YeATS (KEATS). The set of over-expressed genes in these cell lines were determined based on a comparison with the PacBio transcriptome of twenty tissues provided by another study (hOPTRS) [2]. MIR155 long non-coding RNA (MIR155HG), Fc fragment of IgE receptor II (FCER2), T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1A (TCL1A), and germinal center associated signaling and motility (GCSAM) were genes having the highest expression counts in the three LCLs with no expression in hOPTRS. Other over-expressed genes, having low expression in hOPTRS, were membrane spanning 4-domains A1 (MS4A1) and ribosomal protein S2 pseudogene 55 (RPS2P55). While some of these genes are known to be over-expressed in LCLs, this study provides a comprehensive cataloguing of such genes. A recent work involving a patient with EBV-positive large B-cell lymphoma was  unusually lacking various B-cell markers, but over-expressing CD30 [3] - a gene ranked 79 among uniquely expressed genes here. Hypomethylation of chromosome 1 observed in EBV immortalized LCLs [4, 5] is also corroborated here by mapping the genes to chromosomes. Extending previous work identifying un-annotated genes [6], 80 genes were identified which are expressed in the three LCLs, not in hOPTRS, and missing in the GENCODE, RefSeq and RefSeqGene databases. KEATS introduces a method of determining expression counts based on a partitioning of the known annotated genes, has runtimes of a few hours on a personal workstation and provides detailed reports enabling proper debugging.\n",
      "Hemidesmosomes (HDs) are epithelial-specific cell-matrix adhesions, which stably anchor the intracellular keratin network to the extracellular matrix. Although their main role is to protect the epithelial sheet from external mechanical strain, how HDs respond to mechanical stress remains poorly understood. Here we identify a pathway essential for HD remodeling, and outline its role with respect to 6{beta}4 integrin recycling. We find that 6{beta}4 integrin chains localize to the plasma membrane/caveolae and Arf6+ endocytic compartments. Based on FRAP and endocytosis assays, integrin recycling between both sites requires the small GTPase Arf6 and its co-regulators GIT1/{beta}PIX, but neither Caveolin1 (Cav1) nor Cavin1. Strikingly, when keratinocytes are stretched or hypo-osmotically shocked, 6{beta}4 integrin accumulates at cell edges, whereas Cav1 disappears from it. This process, which is isotropic relative to the orientation of stretch, depends on Arf6, Cav1 and Cavin1. We propose that mechanically-induced HD growth involves the isotropic flattening of caveolae (known for their mechanical buffering role) associated with integrin diffusion and turnover.\n",
      "Stable cytoplasmic bridges arise from failed cytokinesis, the last step of cell division, and are a key feature of syncytial architectures in the germ line of most metazoans. Whereas the C. elegans germ line is syncytial, its formation remains poorly understood. We studied the role of ANI-2, a noncanonical and shorter form of the actomyosin scaffold protein anillin that is expressed specifically during embryogenesis in the germ line precursor blastomere, P4. We found that the P4 blastomere does not complete abscission following cytokinesis, leaving a stable cytoplasmic bridge between the two daughter cells. Interestingly, depletion of ANI-2 results in a regression of the membrane partition between the two cells, indicating that ANI-2 is required to stabilize the cytoplasmic bridge. We identified several contractility regulators that, like ANI-2, localize to the cytoplasmic bridge and are required to stabilize it. Epistatic analysis of these regulators mutual dependencies revealed a pathway in which Rho regulators promote ANI-2 accumulation at the stable cytoplasmic bridge, which in turns promotes the accumulation of the non-muscle myosin II NMY-2 and the midbody component CYK-7 at the bridge, in part by limiting the accumulation of canonical anillin ANI-1. Our results uncover key steps in C. elegans germ line formation and define a set of conserved regulators that ensure the proper stability of the primordial germ cell cytoplasmic bridge during embryonic development.\n",
      "Neuronal membrane potential resonance (MPR) is associated with subthreshold and network oscillations. A number of voltage-gated ionic currents can contribute to the generation or amplification of MPR, but how the interaction of these currents with linear currents contributes to MPR is not well understood. We explored this in the pacemaker PD neurons of the crab pyloric network. The PD neuron MPR is sensitive to blockers of H- (IH) and calcium-currents (ICa). We used the impedance profile of the biological PD neuron, measured in voltage clamp, to constrain parameter values of a conductance-based model using a genetic algorithm and obtained many optimal parameter combinations. Unlike most cases of MPR, in these optimal models, the values of resonant- (fres) and phasonant- (f{varphi}=0) frequencies were almost identical. Taking advantage of this fact, we linked the peak phase of ionic currents to their amplitude, in order to provide a mechanistic explanation the dependence of MPR on the ICa gating variable time constants. Additionally, we found that distinct pairwise correlations between ICa parameters contributed to the maintenance of fres and resonance power (QZ). Measurements of the PD neuron MPR at more hyperpolarized voltages resulted in a reduction of fres but no change in QZ. Constraining the optimal models using these data unmasked a positive correlation between the maximal conductances of IH and ICa. Thus, although IH is not necessary for MPR in this neuron type, it contributes indirectly by constraining the parameters of ICa.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMany neuron types exhibit membrane potential resonance (MPR) in which the neuron produces the largest response to oscillatory input at some preferred (resonant) frequency and, in many systems, the network frequency is correlated with neuronal MPR. MPR is captured by a peak in the impedance vs. frequency curve (Z-profile), which is shaped by the dynamics of voltage-gated ionic currents. Although neuron types can express variable levels of ionic currents, they may have a stable resonant frequency. We used the PD neuron of the crab pyloric network to understand how MPR emerges from the interplay of the biophysical properties of multiple ionic currents, each capable of generating resonance. We show the contribution of an inactivating current at the resonant frequency in terms of interacting time constants. We measured the Z-profile of the PD neuron and explored possible combinations of model parameters that fit this experimentally measured profile. We found that the Z-profile constrains and defines correlations among parameters associated with ionic currents. Furthermore, the resonant frequency and amplitude are sensitive to different parameter sets and can be preserved by co-varying pairs of parameters along their correlation lines. Furthermore, although a resonant current may be present in a neuron, it may not directly contribute to MPR, but constrain the properties of other currents that generate MPR. Finally, constraining model parameters further to those that modify their MPR properties to changes in voltage range produces maximal conductance correlations.\n",
      "Systemic inflammation can impair cognition with relevance to dementia, delirium and post-operative cognitive dysfunction. Acute episodes of delirium also contribute significantly to rates of long-term cognitive decline, implying that de novo pathology occurs during these acute episodes. Whether systemic inflammation-induced acute dysfunction and acute brain injury occur by overlapping or discrete mechanisms has not been investigated. Here we show that systemic inflammation, induced by bacterial LPS, produces both working memory deficits and acute brain injury in the degenerating brain and that these occur by dissociable IL-1-dependent processes. In normal C57BL/6 mice, LPS (100g/kg) did not affect working memory but robustly impaired contextual fear conditioning (CFC). However prior hippocampal synaptic loss left mice selectively vulnerable to LPS-induced working memory deficits. Systemically administered IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) was protective against, and systemic IL-1{beta} replicated, these working memory deficits. Although LPS-induced deficits still occured in IL-1RI-/- mice, systemic TNF- was sufficient to induce similar deficits, indicating redundancy among these cytokines. Dexamethasone abolished systemic cytokine synthesis and was protective against working memory deficits despite failing to block brain IL-1{beta} synthesis. Direct application of IL-1{beta} to ex vivo hippocampal slices induced non-synaptic depolarisation and irrevesible loss of membrane potential in CA1 neurons from diseased animals and systemic LPS increased apoptosis in the degenerating brain, in an IL-1RI-/- dependent-fashion. The data suggest that LPS induces working memory dysfunction via circulating IL-1{beta} but dysfunction leading to neuronal death is mediated by hippocampal IL-1{beta}. The data suggest that acute systemic inflammation produces both reversible cognitive deficits, resembling delirium, and acute brain injury that may lead to long-term cognitive impairment but that these events are mechanistically dissociable. This would have significant implications for management of cognitive dysfunction and decline during acute illness.\n",
      "Membrane proteins are challenging to study and restraints for structure determination are typically sparse or of low resolution because the membrane environment that surrounds them leads to a variety of experimental challenges. When membrane protein structures are determined by different techniques in different environments, a natural question is \\\"which structure is most biologically relevant?\\\" Towards answering this question, we compiled a dataset of membrane proteins with known structures determined by both solution NMR and X-ray crystallography. By investigating differences between the structures, we found that RMSDs between crystal and NMR structures are below 5 [A] in the membrane region, NMR ensembles have a higher convergence in the membrane region, crystal structures typically have a straighter transmembrane region, have higher stereo-chemical correctness, and are more tightly packed. After quantifying these differences, we used high-resolution refinement of the NMR structures to mitigate them, which paves the way for identifying and improving the structural quality of membrane proteins.\n",
      "Staphylococcus aureus Panton Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) is a pore-forming toxin comprising protein subunits LukS and LukF. Binding of LukS to human C5a receptor (hC5aR) on leukocytes induces secondary binding of LukF and assembly of lytic complexes. Previous analysis suggests that PVL consists of 4-plus-4 LukS/LukF subunits but the exact stoichiometry between LukS, LukF and hC5aR is not yet known. In this study we determine the stoichiometry and spatiotemporal dynamics of functional LukS/LukF-hC5aR complexes in living eukaryotic cells. By using rapid total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and single-molecule photobleaching analysis we found that tetrameric LukS-hC5aR complexes are formed within a cluster of receptors. Upon binding to hC5aR each LukS subunit binds LukF leading to lytic pore formation and simultaneous dissociation of receptors from the complex. Our findings corroborate a hetero-octamer model but provide a new view on the kinetics of crucial virulence factor assembly on integrated host cell membrane receptors.\n",
      "Zika virus (ZIKV) causes microcephaly and congenital eye disease that is characterized by macular pigment mottling, macular atrophy, and loss of foveal reflex. The cell and molecular basis of congenital ZIKV infection are not well understood. Here, we utilized a biologically relevant cell-based system on human fetal retinal pigment epithelial cells (FRPE) and iPSC-derived retinal stem cells (iRSCs) to model ZIKV-ocular cell injury processes. FRPEs were highly susceptible to ZIKV, resulting in apoptosis and decreased viability, whereas iRSCs showed reduced susceptibility. Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses of infected FRPE cells revealed the activation of innate immune and inflammatory response genes, and dysregulation of cell survival pathways, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, phagocytosis, and particle internalization. Nucleoside analogue drug treatment inhibited ZIKV replication and prevented apoptosis. In conclusion, ZIKV affects ocular cells of different developmental stages resulting in cellular injury and death, further providing molecular insight into the pathogenesis of congenital eye disease.\n",
      "Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) is a parasite protein encoded by a multigene family known as var. Expressed on the surface of infected red blood cells, PfEMP1 plays a central role in parasite virulence. The DBL domain of PfEMP1 contains short sequence motifs termed homology blocks. Variation within homology blocks, at the level of single amino-acid modifications, has not been considered before in association with severe disease. Here we identify a total of 2701 amino-acid polymorphisms within DBL homology blocks, the majority of which are shared between two geographically distant study populations in existing transcription data from Kenya and in a new genomic dataset sampled in Ghana. Parasitemia levels and the transcription levels of specific polymorphisms are as predictive of severe disease (AUC=0.83) and of the degree of rosetting (forecast skill SS=0.45) as the transcription of classic var groups. 11 newly categorized polymorphisms were strongly correlated with grpA var gene expression (SS=0.93) and a different set of 16 polymorphisms was associated with the H3 subset (SS=0.20). These associations provide the basis for a novel method of relating pathophysiology to parasite gene expression levels--one that, being site-specific, has more molecular detail than previous models based on var groups or homology blocks. This newly described variation influences disease outcome, and can help develop anti-malarial intervention strategies such as vaccines that target severe disease. Further replication of this analysis in geographically disparate populations and for larger sample sizes can help improve the identification of the molecular causes of severe disease.\n",
      "Membrane tethering is a fundamental process essential for compartmental specificity of intracellular membrane trafficking in eukaryotic cells. Rab-family small GTPases and specific sets of Rab-interacting effector proteins, including coiled-coil tethering proteins and multisubunit tethering complexes, have been reported to be responsible for membrane tethering. However, whether and how these key components directly and specifically tether subcellular membranes still remains enigmatic. Using chemically defined proteoliposomal systems reconstituted with purified human Rab proteins and synthetic liposomal membranes to study the molecular basis of membrane tethering, we established here that Rab-family GTPases have a highly conserved function to directly mediate membrane tethering, even in the absence of any types of Rab effectors such as the so-called tethering proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that membrane tethering mediated by endosomal Rab11a is drastically and selectively stimulated by its cognate Rab effectors, class V myosins (Myo5A and Myo5B), in a GTP-dependent manner. Of note, Myo5A and Myo5B exclusively recognized and cooperated with the membrane-anchored form of their cognate Rab11a to support membrane tethering mediated by trans-Rab assemblies on apposing membranes. Our findings support the novel concept that Rab-family proteins provide a bona fide membrane tether to physically and specifically link two distinct lipid bilayers of subcellular membranes. They further indicate that Rab-interacting effector proteins, including class V myosins, can regulate these Rab-mediated membrane tethering reactions.\n",

      "p97 is a  segregase that plays a key role in numerous ubiquitin-dependent pathways, such as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). It has been hypothesized that p97 extracts proteins from membranes or macromolecular complexes to enable their proteasomal degradation; however, the complex nature of p97 substrates has made it difficult to directly observe the fundamental basis for this activity. To address this issue, we developed a soluble p97 substrate--Ub-GFP modified with K48-linked ubiquitin chains--for in vitro p97 activity assays. We demonstrate for the first time that wild type p97 can unfold proteins and that this activity is dependent on the p97 adaptor NPLOC4-UFD1L, ATP hydrolysis, and substrate ubiquitination, with branched chains providing maximal stimulation. Furthermore, we show that a p97 mutant that causes inclusion body myopathy, Pagets Disease of bone, and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) in humans unfolds substrate faster, suggesting that excess activity may underlie pathogenesis. This work overcomes a significant barrier in the study of p97 and will allow the future dissection of p97 mechanism at a level of detail previously unattainable.\n",
      "Enterococci are important human commensals and significant opportunistic pathogens associated with endocarditis, urinary tract infections, wound and surgical site infections, and medical device associated infections. These infections often become chronic upon the formation of biofilm. The biofilm matrix establishes properties that distinguish this state from free-living bacterial cells and increase tolerance to antimicrobial interventions. The metabolic versatility of the Enterococci is reflected in the diversity and complexity of environments and communities in which they thrive. Understanding metabolic factors governing colonization and persistence in different host niches can reveal factors influencing the transition from commensal to opportunistic pathogen. Here, we report a new form of iron-dependent metabolism for Enterococcus faecalis where, in the absence of heme, respiration components can be utilised for extracellular electron transfer (EET). Iron augments E. faecalis biofilm growth and generates alterations in biofilm matrix, cell spatial distribution, and biofilm matrix properties. We identify the genes involved in iron-augmented biofilm growth and show that it occurs by promoting EET to iron within biofilm.\\n\\nSignificanceBacterial metabolic versatility is often key in dictating the outcome of host-pathogen interactions, yet determinants of metabolic shifts are difficult to resolve. The bacterial biofilm matrix provides the structural and functional support that distinguishes this state from free-living bacterial cells. Here, we show that the biofilm matrix provides access to resources necessary for metabolism and growth which are otherwise inaccessible in the planktonic state. Our data shows that in the absence of heme, components of Enterococcus faecalis respiration (l-lactate dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase) may function as initiators of EET through the cytoplasmic membrane quinone pool and utilize matrix-associated iron to carry out EET. The presence of iron resources within the biofilm matrix leads to enhanced biofilm growth.\n",
      "Intro/abstractAlzheimers disease (AD), a condition characterized by cognitive deficits and progressive loss of memory, is causally linked to the short amyloid peptide A{beta}42, which disrupts normal neurotransmission1,2. Neurotransmitter (NT) release from synaptic vesicles (SV) requires coordinated binding of the conserved core secretory machinery comprised of the soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (vSNARE) synaptobrevin 2 (VAMP2) on the SV and the cognate tSNAREs on the plasma membrane. Synaptophysin (SYP) is the most abundant SV protein3 and the major pre-fusion binding partner of VAMP24. A major challenge in understanding the etiology and prevention of AD is determining the proteins directly targeted by A{beta}42 and elucidating if these targets mediate disease phenotypes. Here we demonstrate that A{beta}42 binds to SYP with picomolar affinity and disrupts the SYP/VAMP2 complex resulting in inhibition of both neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. While functionally redundant paralogs of SYP have masked its critical activity in knockout studies5,6, we now demonstrate a profound seizure susceptibility phenotype in SYP knockout mice that is recapitulated in an AD model mouse. Our studies imply a subtle yet critical role for SYP in the synaptic vesicle cycle and the etiology of AD.\n",

      "Change is the most fundamental property of biomarker. Contrast to the blood, which is under homeostatic controls, urine reflects changes in the body earlier and more sensitive therefore is a better biomarker source. And drawing blood from infants and toddlers is hard and less tolerated. For patients limited by language, giving chief complaint is difficult. Thus, monitoring biomarkers in urine can provide valuable clues for diagnosis of diseases, especially pediatric diseases. Collecting urine from young children and some adult patients is more challenging than collecting it from healthy adults. Here, we propose a method that uses a fluff pulp diaper to collect urine. Urinary proteins were then eluted and adsorbed onto a piece of nitrocellulose membrane, which can be dried and stored in a vacuumed bag. SDS-PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis indicated that this method is reproducible, and similar proteins were identified as those obtained using an acetone precipitation method. With this simple economical method, it is possible to collect and preserve urine samples from infants, toddlers, and patients with special needs, even for large-scale biomarker studies.\n",
      "Plant cells are surrounded by walls, which must often meet opposing functional requirements during plant growth and defense. The cells meet them by modifying wall structure and composition in a tightly controlled and adaptive manner. The modifications seem to be mediated by a dedicated cell wall integrity (CWI) maintenance mechanism. Currently the mode of action of the mechanism is not understood and it is unclear how its activity is coordinated with established plant defense signaling. We investigated responses to induced cell wall damage (CWD) impairing CWI and the underlying mechanism in Arabidopsis thaliana. Interestingly inhibitor- and enzyme-derived CWD induced similar, turgor-sensitive stress responses. Genetic analysis showed that the receptor-like kinase (RLK) FEI2 and the mechano-sensitive, plasma membrane-localized Ca2+- channel MCA1 function downstream of the THE1 RLK in CWD perception. Phenotypic clustering with 27 genotypes identified a core group of RLKs and ion channels, required for activation of CWD responses. By contrast, the responses were repressed by pattern-triggered immune (PTI) signaling components including PEPR1 and 2, the receptors for the immune signaling peptide AtPep1. Interestingly AtPep1 application repressed CWD-induced phytohormone accumulation in a PEPR1/2-dependent manner. These results suggest that PTI suppresses CWD-induced defense responses through elicitor peptide-mediated signaling during defense response activation. If PTI is impaired, the suppression of CWD-induced responses is alleviated, thus compensating for defective PTI.\\n\\nSignificance statementStress resistance and plant growth determine food crop yield and efficiency of bioenergy production from ligno-cellulosic biomass.

      "The spatiotemporal coordination of actin regulators in the lamellipodium determines the dynamics and architecture of branched F-actin networks during cell migration. The WAVE complex, effector of Rac1 during cell protrusion, is concentrated at the lamellipodium tip. Yet, correlation of Rho GTPases activation with cycles of membrane protrusions, suggested that Rac1 activation is not synchronized with membrane protrusion and occurs behind the lamellipodium. However, RhoA activation is maximal at the cell edge and synchronized with edge progression. Combining single protein tracking (SPT) and super-resolution imaging with loss- or gain-of-function of Rho GTPases mutants, we demonstrate that Rac1 immobilizations at the lamellipodium tip are correlated with Rac1 activation, on the contrary to RhoA. We show that Rac1 effector WAVE and Rac1 regulator IRSp53 accumulate at the lamellipodium tip by membrane free-diffusion and trapping. Nevertheless, wild-type Rac1, which directly interacts with WAVE and IRSp53, only displays slower diffusion at the lamellipodium tip, suggesting fast local activation/inactivation cycles. Local optogenetic activation of Rac1, triggered by Tiam1 membrane recruitment, proves that Rac1 activation must occur at the lamellipodium tip and not behind the lamellipodium to trigger efficient membrane protrusion. Furthermore, coupling tracking with optogenetic activation of Rac1 demonstrates that Rac1-WT diffusive properties are unchanged despite enhanced lamellipodium protrusion. Taken together, our results support a model where Rac1 is rapidly switching between activation and inhibition at the lamellipodium tip, ensuring a local and fast control of Rac1 actions on its targets.\\n\\nSignificanceRac1 and RhoA GTPases are molecular switches controlling the actin cytoskeletal during cell migration. WAVE, Rac1 effector during cell protrusion, is concentrated at the lamellipodium tip. But, recent biosensor imaging studies suggested that Rac1 activation occurs behind the lamellipodium, while RhoA activation is maximal at the cell edge. Using single-molecule imaging and optogentics Rac1 activation we solved this apparent contradiction. We revealed a strong correlation between Rac1 activation and transient immobilizations at the lamellipodium tip, unlike RhoA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Rac1 must be activated at the lamellipodium tip and not away from it to stimulate protrusion. Thus, fast cycling between activation and inhibition at the proximity of Rac1 targets ensures a local and fast control over Rac1 actions.\\n\\nAbbreviations\n",
      "The dynamics of the cytoskeleton and cell shape relies on the coordinated activation of RhoGTPase molecular switches. Among them, Rac1 participates to the orchestration in space and time of actin branching and protrusion/retraction cycles of the lamellipodia at the cell front during mesenchymal migration. Biosensor imaging has revealed a graded concentration of active GTP-loaded Rac1 in protruding regions of the cell. Here, using single molecule imaging and super-resolution microscopy, we reveal an additional supramolecular organization of Rac1. We find that, similarly to H-Ras, Rac1 partitions and is immobilized into nanoclusters of 50-100 molecules each. These nanoclusters assemble due to the interaction of the polybasic tail of Rac1 with the phosphoinositide lipids PIP2 and PIP3. The additional interactions with GEFs, GAPs, downstream effectors, and possibly other partners are responsible for an enrichment of Rac1 nanoclusters in protruding regions of the cell. Using optogenetics and micropatterning tools, we find that activation of Rac1 leads to its immobilization in nanoclusters and that the local level of Rac1 activity matches the local density of nanoclusters. Altogether, our results show that subcellular patterns of Rac1 activity are supported by gradients of signaling nanodomains of heterogeneous molecular composition, which presumably act as discrete signaling platforms. This finding implies that graded distributions of nanoclusters might encode spatial information.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells is a highly organized surface where hundreds of incoming signals are transduced to the intracellular space. How cells encode faithfully this myriad of signals is a fundamental question. Here we show that Rac1, a critical membrane-bound protein involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, forms small aggregates together with other regulating proteins. These supramolecular assemblies, called nanoclusters, are the \\\"quantal\\\" units of signaling. By increasing the local concentration, nanoclusters set thresholds for downstream signaling and ensure the fidelity of information transduction. We found that Rac1 nanoclusters are distributed as spatial gradients matching the patterns of Rac1 activity. We propose that cells can encode positional information through distributed signaling quanta, hereby ensuring spatial fidelity.\n",
      "The dynamics of the cytoskeleton and cell shape relies on the coordinated activation of RhoGTPase molecular switches. Among them, Rac1 participates to the orchestration in space and time of actin branching and protrusion/retraction cycles of the lamellipodia at the cell front during mesenchymal migration. Biosensor imaging has revealed a graded concentration of active GTP-loaded Rac1 in protruding regions of the cell. Here, using single molecule imaging and super-resolution microscopy, we reveal an additional supramolecular organization of Rac1. We find that, similarly to H-Ras, Rac1 partitions and is immobilized into nanoclusters of 50-100 molecules each. These nanoclusters assemble due to the interaction of the polybasic tail of Rac1 with the phosphoinositide lipids PIP2 and PIP3. The additional interactions with GEFs, GAPs, downstream effectors, and possibly other partners are responsible for an enrichment of Rac1 nanoclusters in protruding regions of the cell. Using optogenetics and micropatterning tools, we find that activation of Rac1 leads to its immobilization in nanoclusters and that the local level of Rac1 activity matches the local density of nanoclusters. Altogether, our results show that subcellular patterns of Rac1 activity are supported by gradients of signaling nanodomains of heterogeneous molecular composition, which presumably act as discrete signaling platforms. This finding implies that graded distributions of nanoclusters might encode spatial information.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells is a highly organized surface where hundreds of incoming signals are transduced to the intracellular space. How cells encode faithfully this myriad of signals is a fundamental question. Here we show that Rac1, a critical membrane-bound protein involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, forms small aggregates together with other regulating proteins. These supramolecular assemblies, called nanoclusters, are the \\\"quantal\\\" units of signaling. By increasing the local concentration, nanoclusters set thresholds for downstream signaling and ensure the fidelity of information transduction. We found that Rac1 nanoclusters are distributed as spatial gradients matching the patterns of Rac1 activity.

      "Hotspots of rapid genome evolution hold clues about human adaptation. Here, we present a comparative analysis of nine whole-genome sequenced primates to identify high-confidence targets of positive selection. We find strong statistical evidence for positive selection acting on 331 protein-coding genes (3%), pinpointing 934 adaptively evolving codons (0.014%). Our stringent procedure and quality control of alignments and evolutionary inferences reveal substantial artefacts (20% of initial predictions) that have inflated previous estimates of positive selection, the large majority relating to transcript definitions (61%) or gene models (38%). Our final set of 331 positively selected genes (PSG) are strongly enriched for innate and adaptive immune functions, secreted and cell membrane proteins (e.g. pattern recognition, complement, cytokine pathways, defensins, immune receptors, MHC, Siglecs). We also find evidence for positive selection in reproduction, chromosome segregation and meiosis (e.g. centromere-associated CENPO, CENPT), apolipoproteins, smell/taste receptors, and proteins interacting with mitochondrial-encoded molecules. Focusing on the virus-host interaction, we retrieve most evolutionary conflicts known to influence antiviral activity (e.g. TRIM5, MAVS, SAMHD1, tetherin) and predict 70 novel cases through integration with virus-host interaction data (virus-human PPIs, immune cell expression, infection screens). Protein structure analysis identifies positive selection in the interaction interfaces between viruses and their human cellular receptors (CD4 - HIV; CD46 [MCP] - measles, adenoviruses; CD55 [DAF] - picornaviruses). Finally, the primate PSG consistently show high sequence variation in human exomes, suggesting ongoing evolution. Our curated dataset of positively selected genes and positions, available at http://www.cmbi.umcn.nl/[~]rvdlee/positive_selection/, is a rich source for studying the genetics underlying human (antiviral) phenotypes.\n",
      "Regeneration of body parts requires the replacement of multiple cell types. To dissect this complex process, we utilized planarian flatworms that are capable of regenerating any tissue after amputation. An RNAi screen for genes involved in regeneration of the pharynx identified a novel gene, Pharynx regeneration defective-1 (PHRED-1) as essential for normal pharynx regeneration. PHRED-1 is a predicted transmembrane protein containing EGF, Laminin G, and WD40 domains, is expressed in muscle, and has predicted homologs restricted to other lophotrochozoan species. Knockdown of PHRED-1 causes abnormal regeneration of muscle fibers in both the pharynx and body wall muscle. In addition to defects in muscle regeneration, knockdown of PHRED-1 or the bHLH transcription factor MyoD also causes defects in muscle and intestinal regeneration. Together, our data demonstrate that muscle plays a key role in restoring the structural integrity of closely associated organs, and in planarians it may form a scaffold that facilitates normal intestinal branching.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nHighlights-PHRED-1 is a predicted transmembrane protein that contains Laminin G, EGF and WD40 domains\\n\\n-PHRED-1 is required for normal muscle patterning during regeneration\\n\\n-phred-1 is expressed in muscle cells\\n\\n-Muscle forms an essential scaffold for regeneration\n",
      "Erythrocytes in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are associated with reduced cell deformability and elevated blood viscosity, which contribute to impaired blood flow and other pathophysiological aspects of diabetes related vascular complications. In this study, by using a two-component red blood cell (RBC) model and systematic parameter variation, we perform detailed computational simulations to probe the alteration of the biomechanical, rheological and dynamic behavior of T2DM RBCs in response to morphological change and membrane stiffening. First, we examine the elastic response of T2DM RBCs subject to static tensile forcing and their viscoelastic relaxation response upon release of the stretching force. Second, we investigate the membrane fluctuations of T2DM RBCs and explore the effect of cell shape on the fluctuation amplitudes. Third, we subject the T2DM RBCs to shear flow and probe the effects of cell shape and effective membrane viscosity on their tank-treading movement. In addition, we model the cell dynamic behavior in a microfluidic channel with constriction and quantify the biorheological properties of individual T2DM RBCs. Finally, we simulate T2DM RBC suspensions under shear and compare the predicted viscosity with experimental measurements. Taken together these simulation results and their comparison with currently available experimental data are helpful in identifying a specific parametric model the first of its kind that best describes the main hallmarks of T2DM RBCs, which can be used in future simulation studies of hematologic complications of T2DM patients.\n",
      "Chlamydia trachomatis delivers multiple Type 3 secreted effector proteins to host epithelial cells to manipulate cytoskeletal functions, membrane dynamics and signaling pathways. TepP is the most abundant effector protein secreted early in infection but its molecular function is poorly understood. In this report, we provide evidence that TepP is important for bacterial replication in cervical epithelial cells, the activation of Type I IFN genes, and the recruitment of Class I phosphoinositide 3 kinases (PI3K) and the signaling adaptor protein CrkL to nascent pathogen-containing vacuoles (inclusions). We also show that TepP is a target of tyrosine phosphorylation by Src kinases but these modifications do not appear to influence the recruitment of PI3K or CrkL. The translocation of TepP correlated with an increase in the intracellular pools of phosphoinositide 3,4,5 triphosphate but not the activation of the pro-survival kinase Akt, suggesting that TepP-mediated activation of PI3K is spatially restricted to early inclusions. Furthermore, we linked PI3K activity to the dampening of transcription of Type I IFN induced genes early in infection. Overall, these findings indicate that TepP can modulate cell signaling and potentially membrane trafficking events by spatially restricted activation of PI3K.\n",

      "When marked for degradation, surface receptor and transporter proteins are internalized and delivered to endosomes where they are packaged into intralumenal vesicles (ILVs). Many rounds of ILV formation create multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that fuse with lysosomes exposing ILVs to hydrolases for catabolism. Despite being critical for protein degradation, the molecular underpinnings of MVB-lysosome fusion remain unclear, although machinery underlying other lysosome fusion events is implicated. But how then is specificity conferred? And how is MVB maturation and fusion coordinated for efficient protein degradation? To address these questions, we developed a cell-free MVB-lysosome fusion assay using S. cerevisiae as a model. After confirming that the Rab7 ortholog Ypt7 and the multisubunit tethering complex HOPS are required, we found that the Qa-SNARE Pep12 distinguishes this event from homotypic lysosome fusion. Mutations that impair MVB maturation block fusion by preventing Ypt7 activation, confirming that a Rab-cascade mechanism harmonizes MVB maturation with lysosome fusion.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTEndocytosis culminates with multivesicular bodies (MVBs) fusing with lysosomes. But the molecular underpinnings of this event remain unclear. Here, using S. cerevisiae as a model, Karim et al. employ a new in vitro assay to show that MVB-lysosome fusion is driven by ESCRT-dependent Rab-GTPase activation and the syntaxin ortholog Pep12, distinguishing it from other lysosome membrane fusion events.\n",

      "The topologies of -helical membrane proteins are generally thought to be determined during their cotranslational insertion into the membrane. It is typically assumed that membrane topologies remain static after this process has ended. Recent findings, however, question this static view by suggesting that some parts of, or even the whole protein, can reorient in the membrane on a biologically relevant time scale. Here, we focus on anti-parallel homo-or hetero-dimeric Small Multidrug Resistance proteins, and examine whether the individual monomers can undergo reversible topological inversion (flip-flop) in the membrane until they are trapped in a fixed orientation by dimerization. By perturbing dimerization using various means, we show that the membrane topology of a monomer is unaffected by the presence or absence of its dimerization partner. Thus, membrane-inserted monomers attain their final topologies independently of dimerization, suggesting that wholesale topological inversion is an unlikely event in vivo.\n",
      "Triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells (TREM2) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is expressed in macrophages, dendritic cells, microglia, and osteoclasts. TREM2 plays a role in phagocytosis, regulates release of cytokine, contributes to microglia maintenance, and its ectodomain is shed from the cell surface. Using both pharmacological and genetic approaches we report here that the main protease contributing to the release of TREM2 ectodomain is ADAM17, (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain containing protein, also called TACE, TNF converting enzyme) while ADAM10 plays a minor role. Using mutational analysis, we demonstrate that the main cleavage site of the sheddases is located within the stalk region of TREM2 proximal to the plasma membrane. Complementary biochemical experiments reveal that cleavage occurs between histidine 157 and serine 158. Shedding is not altered for the R47H-mutated TREM2 protein that confers an increased risk for the development of Alzheimers disease. O-glycosylation is detected within the stalk region, but distant to the cleavage site. These findings reveal a link between shedding of TREM2 and its regulation during inflammatory conditions or chronic neurodegenerative disease like AD in which activity or expression of sheddases might be altered.\n",
      "ABSTRACTThe COPI coat forms transport vesicles from the Golgi complex and plays a poorly defined role in endocytic trafficking. Here we show that COPI mediates delivery of a budding yeast SNARE (Snc1) from early endosomes to the Golgi complex through recognition of a polyubiquitin sorting signal. Snc1 is a v-SNARE that drives fusion of exocytic vesicles with the plasma membrane, and then recycles through early endosomes back to the Golgi for reuse. Removal of ubiquitin from Snc1, or deletion of a {beta}-COP subunit propeller domain that binds K63-linked polyubiquitin, causes aberrant accumulation of Snc1 in early endosomes. Moreover, replacement of the {beta}-COP propeller domain with unrelated ubiquitin-binding domains restores Snc1 recycling. These results indicate that ubiquitination, a modification well known to target membrane proteins to the lysosome or vacuole for degradation, can also function as recycling signal to sort a SNARE into COPI vesicles at early endosomes for Golgi delivery.\n"

To understand the role of immune function in the human-yeast interaction we classified strains according to their immunomodulatory properties, discovering a set of genetically homogeneous isolates, capable of inducing anti-inflammatory signals via regulatory T cells proliferation, and on the contrary, a positive association between strain mosaicism and ability to elicit inflammatory, IL-17 driven, immune responses. The approach integrating genomics with immune phenotyping showed selection on genes involved in sporulation and cell wall remodeling as central for the evolution of S. cerevisiae Crohns strains from passengers to commensals to potential pathogens.'"
